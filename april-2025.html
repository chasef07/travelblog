            <h3>Friday, April 4th, Mai Chau, Vietnam</h3>
            
            <p>They fixed my drone in Hanoi yesterday! I drove a total of 9 hours on the bike yesterday. That means today I chilled heavy. I am currently in the Mai Chau district. It’s a nice area in a valley surrounded by beautiful rice fields. There are a lot of Israeli backpackers here — it seems like a secret Israeli spot.

                I drove back to Pu Luong today to see the beautiful mountainous terraced rice fields. I ran in the morning but not very well. The altitude really makes running hard.
                
                I want to say some things about countries, cultures, and ethnicities. Many times when I think of a country — for example, “Vietnam” — I group all the people together as “Vietnamese people.” This is a very 2025 limited worldview. Traveling throughout SE Asia, I’ve learned about the complexity of ethnic, cultural, and national identities. It’s very stupid to view people purely by their nationality — especially in countries where the nations themselves are less than 100 years old.
                
                This hit home while traveling in the mountains. You pass various ethnic minority villages, which are not “Vietnamese” per se. Vietnam is home to 54 officially recognized ethnic groups, with the Kinh (Viet) being the largest, making up about 85% of the population. The remaining 53 ethnic minorities include groups with distinct languages, traditions, and histories. Through my travels, it seems that people identify most closely with their ethnicity. I can say that’s true even for myself.
                
                When you take a look at yourself and ask “Who am I?”, what do you think? Your ethnicity greatly influences your culture and customs — much more than your nationality, I’d argue.
                
                I want to integrate into the culture here more. I think that comes with understanding the diverse ethnic and cultural history. Riding a motorbike for so many hours alone is great for some introspection.
                
                My birthday is in three days. I think life is about never being satisfied. You can always improve. You can improve your mind, body, spirituality, emotions. I’m not satisfied. I want to improve in all my faculties. That being said, you have to have respect and happiness for the current state of things — and recognize how far you’ve come.</p>

            <h3>Thursday, April 3rd, Hanoi, Vietnam</h3>
            
            <p>In the morning, I was a rural Vietnamese schoolgirl. In the afternoon, I was a local bike mechanic. Now, I am a big-city tech guy. These are the various faces and walks of life I encountered today. I woke up at 5:45 AM on a mission—to fix MR Drone! I left Pu Luong for Hanoi, driving through beautiful rural villages, passing all the little kids on their way to school. They were riding small electric bikes. It was cute, and I felt like one of them. It reminded me of when I used to drive to school at 6 AM in high school. I was so tired I almost crashed every day—but somehow, I never did. I stopped for gas and coffee. The lady gave me drip coffee, which I had never had before. I was in a rush, so I barely drank any of it before continuing my drive. Slowly, I exited the rural mountains and entered the lowlands. About two hours in, I stopped for an oil change. The guy who sold me my bike told me to get one every 600 km. It had been 600 km, so I stopped to be safe. I want to take good care of it.
                I pulled up to a random bike shop, and the guy changed my oil. Another guy in the shop was holding and petting the most beautiful chicken I have ever seen.
                I continued my journey. The first 2.5 hours were adrenaline-filled and went by quickly. The last two hours were grueling. As I got closer to Hanoi, I found myself stuck behind so many trucks, dirt kicking up in my face. The city traffic was nauseating. I swerved in and out between vehicles. I was on a mission.
                You can’t stop a man on a mission. It feels good to be a man on a mission. To be a man on a mission, you have to care a lot about the cause.
                I really felt like I was in a video game—starting at the crack of dawn in the rural mountains of Vietnam, speeding down winding roads, and now navigating the chaos of the city, dodging cars and bikes. I was frustrated I had to do this. But I told myself I couldn’t complain. How could I? I had bought a bike, was riding through Vietnam with no real destination, no deadlines, and was heading to fix a really nice drone!
                I arrived in Hanoi at 11 AM. It was a five-hour journey.
                I took the drone to the shop. At first, they told me it would take 2–3 days to fix. I told them I’d just go to another shop. No way were they that busy. They ended up taking the drone.
                Then, they told me I needed to replace the entire PCB—for a hefty price. Since I studied EE, I knew they were yanking my chain. I asked to speak with the technician. He explained the issue: the USB-C connector was broken, and the top layer of copper was ripped off.
                I knew some people at TI who could have soldered the connector back on—granted, these are probably some of the best PCB technicians in the world. But I obliged, agreeing to replace the whole PCB for the price. I just really wanted the drone back, and quickly. It wasn’t worth my time or effort to find someone to fix it by hand.
                That brings up an interesting idea about cost and economics. Pricing is a function of demand but also of how badly the consumer wants something and how quickly. These repair shops must have insane profit margins. People will pay a premium for speed.
                I’m now waiting for the drone. Hopefully, he finishes soon with no problems. I want to drive back to the mountains today—I don’t want to stay in Hanoi. The weather here is nice for the first time since I’ve been here, and yet, I’m sitting in a drone shop. Oh well. I can’t complain!</p>

                <h3>Wednesday, April 2nd, Pu Luong, Vietnam</h3>
                
                <p>I took the morning slow. I had a comfy bed and a nice private room for 8 dollars. I got to do some pushups, stretches, and abs. The owner of the homestay told me a route to take to get to my next destination. I followed his advice, hoping to see some stunning views. I drove for about 30 minutes through very remote villages. It was so cool. I drove until I noticed the road stopped. I was in a local village and tried to ask for directions. I didn’t know if I should keep going or turn around. Sometimes you have to drive on unpaved roads to reach the good views, and I thought this was one of those. I managed to communicate with a local farmer. She told me to turn around. I did so and checked the map to see where I went wrong. I’d gone down the wrong road. The journey is all about getting lost anyway. 
                    Before I started driving again, I stopped for some coffee. I was sitting on a beautiful patio overlooking rice fields. I ate crackers. Some local guys invited me to sit with them. I joined them, and they made me drink beer. I obliged. It’s fun laughing with each other when you have no idea what the other is saying. I thanked them and headed off north. 
                    I continued to drive and passed through the terraced rice fields the homestay owner had talked about. I took out my drone and got some awesome footage. I noticed my drone’s battery was dying, so I plugged it into my portable charger. The drone slipped from my hand, but the charging cord stayed attached. When I grabbed it to store it, I noticed the USB-C port had detached. I could no longer charge my drone. I was actually really sad. I’ve been loving flying the drone and want it for my biking adventure. I didn’t know what to do. 
                    I redownloaded WeChat and asked the DJI rep. Long story short, I spent the rest of the afternoon driving around town, trying to find a place to fix it. I went to local electronics stores to see if they could help. I know it’s an easy fix, having soldered many PCBs before. I used a translator to explain the issue. People were willing to help. The problem was that the screws connecting the case, which covers the internal circuitry, were very small, and nobody could find the right size bit. Someone eventually found the right bit, but after messing with it so much, they ended up stripping the screws. So close, yet so far. 
                    I contemplated what to do. I researched and found a DJI-authorized drone repair shop in Hanoi. I decided tomorrow I’ll wake up early and drive 4 hours to get it fixed, hopefully. I found a homestay near the beautiful terraced rice fields. The owner wanted 150,000 dong, or almost 6 dollars. On Booking.com, it was 3 dollars! I showed her, and she gave me the three-dollar price. Tomorrow morning, I’ll start my mission to fix my drone. Nothing can stop a man on a mission. I hope they can fix it and that it’s worth it so I can take amazing footage throughout northern Vietnam.</p>

            <h3>Tuesday April 1st, Pu Luong, Vietnam</h3>
            
            <p>Yesterday was cool, but today was way cooler. I slept pretty well and left touristy Ninh Binh to head north. This was my first biking experience in the mountains and rural Vietnam. I felt so grateful, riding with the wind in my face through unbelievably beautiful landscapes. I felt energized and free. Rice fields and mountains surrounded me on all sides.
                I put my destination into Google Maps, which offered a couple of different routes. I asked ChatGPT which one I should take for the most beautiful scenery, and it recommended the slightly longer one. When I reached the intersection between the two routes, I decided to take the longer one with no large cars. It led me through small villages and roads with no other tourists—or even other vehicles—in sight. The scenery was incredible. I rode fast and confidently.
                About an hour and a half in, I was hyped, flying downhill. Out of nowhere, the nice paved road turned to gravel, dirt, and stones. Anyone who has ridden a motorbike knows that gravel is your worst enemy. I didn’t have enough time to slow down. I slammed on the brakes, but I had too much momentum going downhill. My back wheel lost traction and started swerving left and right. I lost control.
                When I finally regained control, I thought I was safe—but I still couldn’t slow down. Since I was riding a semi-automatic bike, shifting gears was crucial. I tried to shift down to regain control. A lower gear helps slow you down naturally without relying too much on the brakes, preventing skidding. It also gives you better stability and traction, which is crucial on loose gravel.
                Anyway, I was absolutely booking it down this hill at about 60 km/h, my back wheel still swerving side to side. Somehow, I didn’t crash and made it safely. Not to toot my own horn, but I think this cements me as one of the greatest all-terrain motorbike riders in history. I told you back in Gainesville that I was UF’s top rider—now my accolades just keep stacking up.
                After this adrenaline-filled experience, I was still shocked that I didn’t totally eat it. I pulled off to the side of the road and found a beautiful hidden rice field. I took out my drone and got some amazing shots. Some Vietnamese guy tried to talk to me, but he didn’t understand that I didn’t speak a lick of Vietnamese. I continued driving.
                Then, about five minutes later, the phone holder on my motorbike broke. I caught my phone between my legs just in time. The phone holder is absolutely essential for maps and navigating through the mountains of Vietnam. I thought I was screwed. But I literally drove 100 meters, asked the first shop if they had a phone holder, and they did! The woman helped me install it, and I was able to head off with no problems.
                Well, actually, I did notice that my rack, where I store my bags, had snapped a little—but I don’t think it will affect its functionality.
                I kept driving through insane landscapes, stopping a couple more times to fly my drone. Around 5:00 PM, I made it to Pu Luong. The views kept getting better and better—terraced rice fields and the coolest villages I had ever driven through. I turned down some random roads and was continually amazed by the landscapes.
                I found a nice homestay before dark and negotiated the price down by 1,000,000 dong. Now, I’m in a nice private room. I drank rice wine with the owner, and we chatted a little bit.
                Today was amazing. </p>
