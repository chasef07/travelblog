            <h3>Sunday April 1st, Jerusalem, Israel</h3>
            
            <p>Today the volunteering trip ended and marked one week since I left for my travels. There have been so many thoughts and emotions in such a short period of time. Firstly I want to discuss my thoughts about the United States of America. In the trip there were people from France, Australia, Colombia, Canada, and Israel. I have met people from around the world before but to connect with Jews from these countries was a first and hearing about their politics and views was interesting. Also a key aspect of adventure capitalism is exploring international economies and governments and I have become more aware of the corruption and troubles the majority of the world struggles with today. In the past I spoke very pessimistically about the US, how it is a dying regime and culture. That being said, there are still many problems that need to be figured out but comparing to the world it is still the best and most free country on earth. I talked with an Australian guy today and he told me how if you talk bad about aboriginals in Australia a government agency will come throw you in jail. When I explained to him you can say whatever you want in the US he was in shock. He was blown away by the amount of freedoms I take for granted. Next when I explore international economies and governments there is so much corruption going on. The US is still the world’s leading economy and our military is the absolute strongest. These two ideas go hand in hand. Why is a dollar valuable? It’s not pegged to gold or silver or anything materially tangible. It’s valuable because of our military. The USD is backed by the shear fire power of the US military. In most countries a lot of problems come from lack of belief and support in the country’s military. Overall the US military is a very respectable and non-corrupt establishment. Overall America still has extreme social problems to work through and lots of sickness to be weeded out, but comparing to the rest of the world it is still the most free. 
                I will make a different post outlying the problems I see and how we can face them but for now I want to express my gratitude for being American. I am excited for tomorrow to start the trip where I have the whole time to plan and do as I wish. I have really enjoyed making working out at the calisthenics park a pillar of my routine and think this will help drive stability throughout the adventure.</p>
