            <h2>Sunday October 7th 2024, Tel Aviv, Israel</h2>
            
            <p>I started my day energized and inspired. I wrapped tefillin and got dressed to do a hard run for the year anniversary of October 7th. I started walking down the board walk with my headphones in. I noticed the natural beauty of this place. Literally 5 seconds later I see people running to the shelter. It’s crazy on the anniversary of October 7th the people of Israel still are dealing with this. I heard booms from the interceptions. After I ran my fastest 5k yet, 22:04. I ran for the hostages who have been strong for a year and for all the beautiful lives lost a year ago today. If I could emulate a sliver of their strength I’d be happy. After running I met Zach at a fire Hummus spot, Sharon Hummus. We ate and enjoyed. Then we pretty much went to the beach all day and met up with Marissa. We hucked the disc and went in the water. Fish nibbled our feet. Also we found a dead squid and put squid ink under our eyes. It was dark and concentrated. After a long day at the beach we got sushi on Rothschild street. We walked a while to dizengoff for an October 7th memorial. I had amazing gelato at Golda too. After I met up with my friend Neev who moved here from Dallas. It was great seeing him and hearing about his past month in Israel. It’s so cool already in two weeks on the journey meeting up with so many people along the way! </p>

            <h2>Sunday October 6th 2024, Tel Aviv, Israel</h2>
            
            <p>Today I work up in Jerusalem and checked out of our Airbnb. Zack and I headed to the Knesset to meet our camp counselor from Camp Coleman, Itay Gliner. Itay was my counselor at camp over ten years ago. Every time I have been back to Israel my friends and I have made it a point to see him. In 2016, 2022 and now in 2024. We rode the bus up the hill to the Knesset. It was hard getting in at first since we were it in a formal tour but eventually they let us in with some explaining. We met Itay and he took us to his office. He is the press secretary for the speaker of the Knesset! He asked us about our lives and why we are in Israel. We reminisced about going to a reform Jewish summer camp and the pros and cons of the experience. He told us how it was like in the government and in Israel since the war started last year. It was great to see him and connect. He showed us around the speaker’s office and around the Knesset room itself. He explained to us some details of Israeli politics and it was super interesting. We decided to eat lunch at the Knesset because why not?! I had salmon with rice and soup and an ice cream bar. After the great time with him we headed to TLV via train. It was an easy trip this time because we did not miss any trains. We arrived to our hostel, the same one as previously, and met up with Marissa to head to the beach. We went into the water and did beach calisthenics. After our workout Zach showed me his favorite burger he ever had. it was pretty yummy in dizengoff square. The rest of the night Zach Marissa and I got drinks at bars. It was a Sunday night so it was pretty quiet. All in all it was a very nice day. </p>

            <h2>Friday October 4th 2024, Jerusalem, Israel</h2>
            
            <p>I went to the Kotel again in the morning for the second day of Rosh Hashanah. I did the same routine as the day before. When leaving the Kotel a guy stopped me and asked me if wanted to join a Soodah. I asked him what a Soodah was. He explained it is a feast, which is different from a meal. A meal is to eat but a feast is to commemorate and celebrate and food is the mode to do that. I liked that explanation. I ended up talking to this guy for 1.5 hours. He was born in Brooklyn but lives in Israel. He seems about my age. He told me how he is homeless and mentally ill. He gets 4,000 sheckels from the government each month but spends it all in a day. He goes around begging for money. I listened to his story. He started saying how flat concrete is terrible and destroys the human body and how it’s best to walk barefoot in the woods. He also said I should buy a tent and live in the forest to save money. He had interesting ideas and I tried to listen to him openly but after 1.5 hours of talking it was clear he was mentally ill. He said he had mental illness but didn’t specify what. </p>

            <h2>Thursday October 3rd 2024, Jerusalem, Israel</h2>
            
            <p>In Jerusalem everything is closed. Barely any cars on the street and nothing to do. I woke up and went to the Kotel alone. At the Western Wall it was not very crowded, people must have been doing Rosh Hashanah services at their synagogues. It was cool listening to the shofar constantly. I did a silent reflection and meditation and prayed for my friends and family. One sefardic Torah scroll stuck out to me which had the Choshen, the priestly breastplate with twelve gems. It was stunning. I loved seeing all the various groups pray and blow the shofar differently. In the afternoon Zach and I threw the frisbee in the park. We are pretty good and love throwing it together. It’s a good workout and it’s reminiscent of our youth at camp. It’s super nice not having any noise pollution these past few days. There’s no honking or yelling or other sounds. In big urban city centers you don’t realize how bad the noise can be for mental clarity. That’s why it’s so important to be in nature to reflect. In the US when driving a majority of the day or living in a crowded neighborhood you never get silence. Noise and frequency is the basis of creation so it’s extremely important what noise and music and sounds you expose yourself to. The past couple days with no sounds has been so great for mental clarity.</p>

            <h2>Wednesday October 2nd 2024, Jerusalem, Israel</h2>
            
            <p>The past few days have been very chill but filled with very memorable moments. Wednesday night started Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New year. It’s a two day festival where Jews crown Hashem as king and recommit to the oneness and make goals to strive for the next year. On Wednesday night Zach and I joined a local family’s Rosh Hashanah dinner. It was very nice of them to host us. During dinner the host commented how later that evening he was going to see a big rabbi, Reb Itche Meir Morgenstern. The host told us he is the biggest Tzadik of our generation, a very high and righteous being. Zach and I agreed to go check out this rabbi since we have encountered very spiritual people in the past and wanted to see how it compared. Zach, myself, the host and his two teenage sons walked about an hour deep into Mea Shearim. Mea Shearim is a neighborhood in Jerusalem known for being ultra ultra orthodox and fundamentalist. People do not use smart phones and the news is posted on the walls of the city. As we walked through the neighborhood late at night it was cool seeing no cars in the road and kids wandering the streets by themselves. They rode bicycles and scooters and eight year old children walked their 2 year old siblings around. It was like taking a portal back in time. Since it was Rosh Hashanah you cannot use your phone so we had to ask for directions the whole way. We got lost many times through many twists and turns but eventually found our way to the esteemed rabbi. We walked into the building where he was davening Maariv (praying the nightly prayer). I will try my best to paint the picture of what the scene was like. There were probably 1,000 people all dressed in white with payot and large hats. I was wearing a red shirt and stuck out like crazy! The place where the 1,000 people gathered was pretty much a run down concrete structure. There were no walls or ceiling just concrete. It was a mosh pit in there. We had to push and shove our way to the front to try and catch a glimpse of the rabbi. People in the building were screaming and praying very emotionally, looking upwards waving their hands. It was like Dune on steroids. In the front was the fragile old Rabbi. He had a prayer book that was probably 5,000 pages thick. He wore a tallit over his head so you could not see him. We pushed all the way to the front and stood right beside him. Water was dripping from the ceiling while the thousand followers studied and prayed. Every few seconds the rabbi would grab a towel and wipe his eyes. He was crying from the prayer and emotional stimulation. People would gasp when he turned his head, just hoping to catch a glimpse of his mustache and/or face. He took 1.5 hours to do one prayer, the amidah. After the prayer he scurried off into a private room. When he scurried off behind a wall I caught a glimpse of his piercing blue eyes. He came back out five minutes later and his followed all pushed to great him. There was one part of the service where he said words out loud and the 1,000 Jews there did a call and repeat. The rabbi did hand signals for when the congregation to stop and to keep going. After the service everyone pushed to the front to get a blessing from the rabbi. It reminded me of the Travis Scott crowd crunch. It was a mad house. I got my blessing from him as he looked me in the eye and motioned his hand. We walked out of the prayers and enter red to reality. That place was a portal to an alternate universe. It was pretty weird how crazy all the congregation was about one man. It weirded me out but it was cool catching a glimpse into their community and lifestyle. I did not have any crazy spiritual experience while being in his presence. It was more just a show and a mad house in there. </p>

            <h2>Tuesday October 1st 2024, Tel Aviv, Israel</h2>
        
            <p> Today I experienced being under attack by 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles. I want to first start with some thoughts and then I will convey the story via writing and video.  This was the first time I had feared for my life and experienced the psychological effects of terrorism. It is really sad to me that I was personally under attack for being Jewish and being in Israel. In the US and on social media you always see videos and news but it never really feels personal or an attack on your life until you are under fire. It saddened me there are people in the world who hate me but don’t even know me, just because I am Jewish. I try and strive to be compassionate for them even though they are very lost and filled with hate. I experienced the psychological effects of the terror attack. When I ran to my hostel from the shelter I was constantly looking over my shoulder and even the smallest sound scared me. I heard things that sounded like sirens but it was just an ambulance or a door. These small little triggers are the effects of terrorists on the mind. The past week I was walking around care free not worrying about anything. Now I am worried and any loud noise reminded me of a rocket boom or a siren. I have this feeling and I only experienced one attack. I can’t imagine all the Israelis who have gone through it multiple times and stories of US and Israeli militarily members with PTSD from war and booms and attacks. In the parking garage shelter there was a baby. It was sad to see how children and families and people of all ages had to go through this together. I was trying to watch my mind from a bird’s eye view throughout the attack. It was a roller coaster. Right when you think it’s okay and safe you hear a ginormous boom and rattling so close it shakes your bones. Being in the unknown was the most terrifying part. I was not sure if I’d be there for hours or days. This is also a psychological game. As humans we seek control and understanding of events even if they are way beyond our control. We make up fictitious scenarios which stress us out and cause psychological harm. For example I made up a story how terrorists would storm the shelter I was in. Even though this was a real threat it was out of my control. Being comfortable in the unknown in all aspects of life is a true skill for mental stability. The following day, October 2nd, people resumed their lives as normal. There was so much life and happiness. Kids playing in the street, children walking their babies, friends hanging out in cafe’s. For me the effects of the attack calmed down when I saw a bunch of people happy and enjoying their lives immediately. The people of Israel are truly resilient and strong and happy.


                The morning was an amazing. I woke up and ran a 5k on the beach and did push ups and pull ups. It was a beautiful day out. In the afternoon Zach and I decided to go check out the waves for surfing in Jaffa. We left our phones at the hostel and headed to the beach. The conditions were terrible for surfing, mushy waves and very windy, but Zach still wanted to go so I gave in. Mayaan, the owner of the surf shop was super nice. She didn’t charge a lot and gave us all the info on the surf. I returned my board and Mayaan told me, “there will probably be missiles tonight so stay safe”. I didn’t think anything of it because I had not been on my phone and there have been missiles in Israel the whole year. It was just a matter of time. This is around 1800. After surfing Zach and I threw the frisbee on the beach and then went to go get kombucha at a chill spot in town. On the way to the kombucha bar I ran into two people on two separate occasions from our volunteering trip. They both said that there are reports of missiles but did not say anything about the extend. Still Zach and I did not care because we’re Israelis and not tourists. Things began to get real when we left the kombucha bar and saw all the restaurants closing up. The main street of Tel Aviv was a ghost town. It was very eerie. We were still so oblivious since we have not been on our phones in hours. We ask a soldier on the street what’s going on and he said just get back home. It did not seem like there was an imminent threat so we still walked calmly to our hostel. Then on the Main Street as we are walking back to the hostel I see about 10 people run into a hotel. At first I thought they were just guests but then I see more people rushing frantically into an apartment building. We decide to follow them into the building and ask what is going on. We are in the third floor of the stairwell of an apartment building with about 7 other people. A guy lent us his phone and told us Iran is attacking. This was a shock because I thought it would just be one or two missiles from Yemen or hezbollah.It turns out Iran would be sending 200 ballistic missiles, the largest missile attack on any country ever. When I heard the sirens and the announcements for the first time my heart started racing. Then the booms started. We did not know if they were direct hit, interceptions, or the scale of what was going on. For all I knew the building I was in could easily have a direct hit and blow up. Also there were reports of terrorist attacks in Jaffa, where I was an hour earlier which made it seem like a larger coordinated attack. I even had thoughts of terrorists storming the apartment building I was in. The emotions and fear came in waves. At times it was silent, and then all of the sudden the entire apartment would rumble and booms sounding extremely close. I was prepared to shelter for hours if needed. I was so in the dark and clueless about everything going on I tried to surrender. It was a dream like state but my heart was still racing pretty fast. The Israelis we were with were scared too so it didn’t help. When there was a break in the rockets the Israelis said there is a better shelter 100 meters away. I was torn whether to run for it or just stay. I did not know if more missiles would start any minute or a terrorist would be in the streets waiting for us. After contemplation we all went and ran to a parking garage under ground. We stayed in this parking garage for about 15 minutes. The Israelis we were with told us they got an alert it was safe to leave the shelter. Still Zach and I were nervous if we should stay longer or run to the hostel. Like I mentioned for all we know more terrorists could be in the street or more rockets any moment. Everyone was leaving and we didn’t have our phones so we decided to walk/run back. It was crazy. We were on high alert checking every corner. Small noises scared me and I though I heard sirens multiple times but it was just ambulance or other noises. We made it back to the hostel and got our phones and told everyone we are safe. It was around 2230. All the restaurants were closed and we were still hungry. We decided to go back out and look for food. I was nervous going out to the street still but it was important not to let the psychological terror get to me. Most places were closed but some bars were open. The streets were dead. People glanced at me weird as i walked the street. Luckily a grocery store was open and I got hummus and chips. We made it back to the hostel still shaken up and on high alert. We stayed up late talking to our parents and processing everything. Wow what a day I’ll never forget. </p>
