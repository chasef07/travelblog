            <h3>February 7th 2025, Thakhek, Laos</h3>
            <p>Woke up this morning and got a haircut in Vientiane at a really cool barbershop. I really love barbershops because it feels like you are transported back in time if the vibe is set correctly. The shop had incredible decor and nice throwback tunes. It has been fun getting haircuts in different coutnries along my journey. Today was a fantastic cut. Here are the rankings of the haircuts I have had 1. Georgia (refer to Georgia post for the magical haircut I had) 2. Laos 3. Dubai 4. Thailand (two haircuts both sub par). It should be noted I do not just walk into a random shop. I diligently read reviews to find the best one in the given town. This barbershop today was top tier. Anyway after my haircut I took a 6 hour bus ride down to Thakhek Tomorrow I start a four day journey through rural Lao on a motorbike exploring the stunning landscapes and authentic culture. I am very excited for the adventure that awaits. Since that is the only recap for the day I want to briefly comment on city and coutnryside life. I have become fascinated by urban desgin and even suburban design. After talking to my Europen friends and comparing and contrasting the places we live I noticed something really staggering. American cities and suburbs are so damn overcrowded. I saw the population and beautiful nature of the European suburbs and was stunned. I really felt the chaos of urbanization and overcrowdedness when I lived in Dallas for two years. Even in the sububrs of Tampa Bay it is too crowded. The constant noise, simulation, and go-go-go mentality creates unwanted mental pressure which can obscure your thoughts and intuintion. It is clear living in nature, in tune with the cycle of life is the best. It would be great to have a farm and some animals some day. Since everything is One, picking your surroundings is essential to building your individual vessel. </p>

            <p>Wow it’s so nice not seeing homeless people for 4 months. I just realized this. I thought I saw a homeless person standing limp in the street but it was just a tree! Homelessness really ruins a city, makes it unsafe, and makes it dirty. Nowhere I have been my whole trip had homeless people just in the streets. Yes there is some extreme poverty and begging but no tent cities or cracked out people. Anyway I took the speed train to the capital of Lao today, Vientiane. People have been saying bad things about this place how you only need one night or even skip it completely. I think it’s important as the international landscaper to see the capital city. There is a reason it’s the capital. I have actually really enjoyed my day and time here! There are really nice cafes and restaurants lining the streets and very nice markets across the Mekong river. I had one of the best herbal wet saunas of my life accompanied by a honey coffee body scrub. I also ate an amazing poke bowl for the first time since Israel. In USA I ate a poke bowl almost every week, it is my favorite. It is essential on longterm travels to balance out the on the go lifestyle with days to just do some chores like laundry and get new supplies at the mall. Since Lao is a 3rd world country the best place to do that is the capital city. </p>

            <h3>February 4th 2025, Vang Vieng, Laos</h3>
            <p>Life is for sharing. I have a lot of thoughts today. I want to give a recap of last evening and today but want to get to some introspection. Yesterday I did paramotoring for the first time and it was one of the coolest experiences ever. I went up high into the sky at sunset and flew over the beautiful landscape of Vang Vieng. I highly recommend it to anyone. Now today. I have been on the go ever since I started solo traveling. Recently I have had the itch to find some seclusion, volunteer, and get into a routine. Today I woke up and rented a motorbike to drive an hour to a village. I only saw one picture on instagram about it and have heard nobody talk about it here. I was excited to see what this adventure would get me into. I have been traveling with my friends I met in Thailand for about two weeks now and today was supposed to be the day I return to being solo. When I took the bike and left the city I was stopped at a toll station to get on the highway. The officer there said that it is only for cars so I had to turn around. It was okay because I rerouted to avoid tolls. I drove 1.5 hours outside of Vang Vieng before turning another checkpoint for the same highway. Again the officers said only cars around. I looked on my maps to se if there was any other way to get to this town, but there was not. I was faced with the decision to either find a new small village and see where it takes me or return back to Vang Vieng. When I started the motorbike drive this morning leaving my friend of two weeks I immediately felt something was wrong. I started to ask myself why I was forcing this seclusion idea. Yes it is true I want to get into a routine, but I also realized I really enjoy sharing experiences with others. This Is the meaning of life. Sharing your energy to others or a grand vision and giving it your all. Yes solo backpacking is cool and you really have so much time to introspect and iron out your ego. However, when it comes to creating experiences it is best shared with others. That being said I still am going to find some seclusive introspective time when the time is right, but it is not something that needs to be forced. For personal growth obviously being alone is key, but for experiencing life sharing is the way to go. That is a feature of nature and creation because making a family and babies is the only way the human race perpetuates. After I got back to Vang Vieng from my two hour motorbike ride I needed to workout hard. I did pushups, sit-ups and Bulgarian split squats. I have been working out and getting into great shape on this trip but I think I can give even more. I really want to fix my hip pain and I am not putting in enough work to do so. After my workout I found a place to train Muay Thai. I had a 1-1 session with a pro Peruvian Muay Thai fighter. He worked me hard and it was so technical. From the angle of your steps before a kick to how far your elbow should be when you throw an elbow. What I know for sure is all your power is generated in your hips. You need to throw your entire being into a kick or a punch. He commented how I was stiff in my shoulders and I need to relax. This is sadly a genetic predisposition of mine. It was nice to train Muay Thai again for the first time in Lao. I learned a lot today from my bike extravaganza and I am excited to see how I will curate the rest of my trip. </p>

            <h3>February 3rd 2025, Vang Vieng, Laos</h3>
            <p>I am writing this Monday morning at 8 AM. I have been waking up early ever since the 3 day trek in. Nong Khiaw which I have liked. Yesterday was a great day and one of my favorites of the trip so far. Anton Rachel and I rented bicycles and rove around the whole town of Vang Xiang. Vang Vieng is a nice backpacker village with a river and tons of limestone carts surrounding the town. I have not rode a bicycle in a really long time so it was a great idea. Vang Vieng is known for multiple blue lagoons where you can chill, swim, and jump off rope swings. We biked about an hour to one of the many blue lagoons. The roads here are covered in potholes and not paved at all so it was pretty difficult to bike. I had a city bike with only one gear which made it difficult. At the blue lagoon I led a yoga session for my friends and ate some corn before going for a swim. I did not know the exact definition of a lagoon so here it is: a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by a barrier. The lagoons in Vang Vieng are fed by underground springs and streams. After going to the first lagoon we biked to lunch before headed to another lagoon. The next lagoon we went to had more rope swings and jumps. I did a rope swing and tried to do a back flip off of it but landed on my face. I am not a flipper. I was pretty tired from biking all day but the nice lagoon water woke me up. After a full day we biked during sunset almost two hours. The landscapes were so stunning and beautiful. We saw children laughing and playing. Hot air balloons and paramotors filled the skies. Today I am going to do paramotoring at sunset which I am so excited about. I have been moving city to city pretty quickly for about a month. I am looking forward to finding a place to get into a nice routine for a little. From Nong Khiaw a couple days ago I took the beautiful Lao China railway. I want to share some thoughts about the China-Lao relationship, the recent world economic forum, cardinal vs celestial north, and some more. Oh also I met a really cool and nice guy in my hostel dorm yesterday, Ofri from a north kibbutz of Israel. We talked about life and scaling wealth. He was so genuine and full of love. It was such a great conversation and connection. </p>
