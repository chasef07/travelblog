            <h3>Tuesday, June 17th, Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia</h3>
            
                <p>I have been thinking a lot about business recently. I spent today using ChatGPT to research various business ideas. As some of my entrepreneurial friends and I have discussed, it is actually quite easy to make money and a business. I explored solar panel farms to name one of many ideas. There are infinite possibilities it is almost overwhelming. I realized I needed to bound the problem, bound my interests more. Maybe one of the most important things I learned from working at Texas Instruments was bounding big messy problems to something more manageable. So if I was going to start a solar panel farm I could take out huge loans and probably make a return in 6 to 8 years. It would be meaningful and interesting, however the lifestyle which comes with it is not ideal. This is a problem for any in person business. You have to stay local in one place and usually returns are slow, but relatively certain. With my keen interest in travels and tech I became certain I need to find a way to make money from my laptop. This is the first time in human history you can do so, so why not take advantage of it? This bounds my business and job search significantly. Now after condensing my space I noticed an area to reduce the size more. There are many ways to make money online that are easy but not meaningful. Whether it is a jewelry box subscription or. a dating coach there are many vain jobs I have heard of  that do make money. Therefore that leaves you with meaningful jobs you can do from a laptop. With this in mind I have been researching extensively the plethora of cool AI tools out there. I am a big proponent of all the chatbots and tell all my friends to use them. However there is way more AI tools to uncover that most people never look at. You can design your own workflows and create apps. Tools like replit, cursor, n8n are tools I have never heard of until recently. There are so many cool tools that are untapped. I am excited to explore this more. I feel like I have a strong technical background and the interpersonal skills needed to build onto of the AI tools being made. It is still difficult to work really focused and hard while traveling and seeing some stuff but I look forward to getting into more of a routine to explore. </p>

            <h3>Friday, June 13th, Uluwatu, Bali, Indonesia</h3>
            
                <p>Ok the word Is out, I am a perfectionist! My whole life I have always wanted to be the best at everything I do. Whether it is academics or sports or just random skills. I want to perfect them all. I am very grateful I am naturally gifted at many things. I always am searching how to improve my mind body emotions and soul. Throughout this adventure I have improved myself and habits so much. However I still yearn for more. I believe this will be a life long yearning. Never to be satisfied with the status quo. Always upward and onward. On the other hand you must give yourself grace and see how far you have come and be patient. Recently I have been craving routine to get into focused high growth mode. This is pretty difficult while backpacking and moving around so much trying to see the country. However I learned from that slower is better while traveling. It is best to stay in a place at least 5 nights, preferably more if you like it. As I look to wind down my trip I begin to think about important habits I must continue. Today I went to the sauna and cold plunge on the cliffs of Uluwatu overlooking a world famous surf break. The sauna and cold plunge make me so focused and relaxed. Now back to surfing. As I mentioned I am naturally gifted at many sports, but surfing is one of the more difficult ones to get a hang of. That being said I really have only surfed for 5 days maybe, less than 20 hours total. I think I can become a pro while only just starting. That is silly. To master any skill it takes repetition, patience and time. I am going to continue to put in more hours in surfing. </p>

            <h3>Wednesday, June 11th, Uluwatu, Bali, Indonesia</h3>
            
                <p>Uluwatu, Bali, a pretty  interesting place. I am on a really cool beach called Balangan Beach. I am paying 8 dollars a night for a private room with a fan, shared bathroom, and directly on the beach. You can hear the waves crashing at night. In the morning you can wake up and look outside and see surfers shredding it up. Waking up and walking directly on the beach is very nice and relaxing. Uluwatu is fairly removed from the spiritual hub of Ubud. You can see some temples and offerings of incense on the fronts of businesses, but not nearly as immersive as in Ubud. I really liked the immersive balinese culture in Ubud. Uluwatu is a large area with many beaches and surf breaks. The road infrastructure is terrible. There are tons of villas under construction and investment opportunities. The main shopping area near Padang Padang beach has tons of viber cafes, wellness centers, and surf shops. The surf at Balangan Beach has been a step up. Today was my first day attempting to surf here. The waves are way more powerful than in Siargao. The volume of water is crazy. It makes you realize right in front of your eyes the awesomeness of hashem’s creation. </p>

            <h3>Sunday, June 8th, Ubud, Bali, Indonesia</h3>
            
                <p>The violet flame of Saint Germain is said to be the path to immortality, capable of opening all the doors. If you’re asking yourself, “What the fuck does that mean?” — I felt the same way today. It all started yesterday when I met Dennis from Southern California at an AcroYoga class at Yoga Barn. After my first AcroYoga class in Siargao, Philippines (which I enjoyed a lot), I decided to find one here in Bali. So I went to the Yoga Barn — the Mecca of yoga. Seriously, I think it’s the most insane yoga facility in the world. It’s a huge complex with multiple buildings and probably over 30 different classes a day. There's Hatha, Vinyasa, Kundalini, Acro, Aerial, Sound Bowl Meditation, Ecstatic Dance — and more. At the AcroYoga class, there were easily over 30 people. We paired up in groups of three: one base, one flyer, one spotter. I somehow ended up in a group with two American guys. One was a late-30s hippie yoga dude, and the other was 75-year-old Dennis. Dennis lives part of the year in Bali and part in SoCal. He’s about five foot six, in great shape, and wore a large rock amulet necklace. He seemed grounded and chill.
                    We did the class together — Dennis was very flexible and strong. Afterward, we started talking and I found out he’s Jewish. He invited me to his house to try a sound healing therapy he conducts — completely free and very chill about it. I was in.
                    I’d done sound healing before — once in Boulder, Colorado, at a Nepalese shop, and another time in St. Pete, Florida, also at a Nepalese store. Later that evening, Dennis told me to meet him at his club at 9 AM: Titi Batu. I looked it up — it’s one of the most famous gym-sauna-pool setups in Bali.
                    Now I was intrigued. Who is this Dennis guy? The next morning (today), I drove my motorbike to Titi Batu. It’s tucked in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by cafés and a paddle court center. On a Sunday morning, Titi Batu was popping. It’s a massive complex with beautiful swimming pools, a state-of-the-art gym, sauna, steam room, cold plunge, basketball court, skate park, and a full kitchen. I realized: Dennis is a certified adventure capitalist. Probably the most legit one I’ve met. This place was easily a tens-of-millions-of-dollars project. It opened six years ago, but Dennis first came to Bali in 2013, when much of the land was rice fields — ripe with opportunity. After selling his business in LA (I don’t know what it was, unfortunately), he said he was too dynamic to just retire and chill. He found a Balinese business partner and opened this amazing club. He told me the roof is made of repurposed old ships, and that he originally wanted to build a red clay tennis court — but was advised a skate park would hold 40 people, not just 4. Before we left, he offered me a free pass to use the club later. As we walked out, I saw him kiss the doorpost. I looked closer: a mezuzah. Tiny and discreet, you’d never notice unless you were really looking. He said kindness is his religion now, and the mezuzah is like a “doorbell to heaven.” Oh — also, he was a celibate monk for ten years in his 20s. Dennis led me by motorbike through Ubud’s back roads and rice fields. I was wondering what kind of house he lived in. I figured, given Bali’s modest architecture, he’d have a nice but simple apartment — probably tastefully decorated with art, since he seemed single and spiritual. We pulled into a small parking area near a mechanic shop and an abandoned house. Nothing from the outside gave any clue of what lay beyond. We walked past a home Dennis said belonged to Icelandic musician Ólafur Arnalds. Then we arrived.
                    His house was — and I don’t say this lightly — the most beautiful home I’ve ever seen. It was basically my dream home. You entered by walking over a koi pond with flowing water. To the left was a massive 12-foot Buddha head fountain. Most of the home was open-air, surrounded by lush jungle and coconut trees. The outdoor kitchen was right in front of his bedroom. He invited me in, saying, “When I wake up, I look up and see God.” I looked up — it was an intricate ceiling piece salvaged from a 200-year-old temple. They built the roof over it. He wakes up and sees God above him, and out his window, God in nature. Buddha heads and meditative icons lined his room. Books and supplements everywhere.
                    Downstairs (this place had like four levels — but all flowing, mostly open-air), we passed a beautiful pool, outdoor swings, statues, massive couches — the works. Dennis took me to a room with a bed and a massage table. It also had a steam room and a sauna.
                    We started with AcroYoga. I went up on his feet, hanging my body weight on him. “This is how monkeys carry their babies,” he said. He massaged my head and pulled my earlobes. Then I lay down. He explained he had two sets of super rare quartz tuning forks — only 300 exist in the world. “They’re like my children,” he said. He started playing sound bowls on my chest and chanting soft “AUM”s. Then came the tuning forks.
                    He tapped them and placed the vibrating ends on different parts of my body — third eye, lips, hips, feet. There were four rounds. The forks had names: The Grandmother, The Indian Fork, one I forgot… and then the finale — The Violet Flame of Saint Germain.
                    During the session, I thought about my future, my family. I want to be an adventure capitalist, a global entrepreneur. I have infinite ideas — it's hard to focus on just one. After 45 minutes, I got up feeling loopy and relaxed. He told me I should feel more clarity and integration. I think I did.
                    He also hit a spinning rhomboid above me — some sacred geometry thing.
                    We chatted after the session. I wanted to learn everything from him. He had the dream house, the business, the lifestyle. But I didn’t want to bombard him with questions. I’ve met other adventure capitalists before. I always naïvely want them to tell me the recipe — but that’s not how it works. Dennis told me: “Find a niche. Find a need. Work hard at it.”
                    He said to imagine yourself with no restrictions — and do exactly that.
                    It reminded me: we often see the fruits of someone’s labor without seeing the years of work that built the roots. On the way out, I saw a fully custom copper bathtub for two outside, surrounded by jungle. It took four months to make. Pure magic. Later, I went back to Titi Batu to use the gym and sauna. Then, on my way to lunch, I got caught in torrential rain. Traffic stopped as 40 men carried a giant bed-like structure through the street — singing, dancing. It looked like a funeral, with a white-wrapped body on the bed. It was beautiful and chaotic. Bali has a rich culture — you just have to bump into it. There are so many cool people doing amazing things here. The energy is inspiring. Sure, there are also weird hippies doing weird hippie stuff. But there’s also this new age archetype — people who take health and spirituality seriously without being too out there.
                    Funny enough, the two coolest adventure capitalists I’ve met this whole trip were both American guys who do AcroYoga. Anyway, I could see myself living here — surrounded by cool people doing cool things. I think we should optimize our lives to do the coolest things possible.
                    I don’t want to go home and just work a boring old job again.
                    Envision yourself unbounded, with no restrictions — and do that.
                    That’s what I plan to do. </p>

                <h3>Friday, June 6th, Ubud, Bali, Indonesia</h3>
            
                <p>I woke up this morning in Ubud with the scent of lemongrass lingering in the air and the promise of calm on the horizon. My day began at a traditional Balinese spa tucked into the jungle — one of those places where time seems to slow down.

                    I got a Balinese massage, which, if I’m being honest, felt like a standard massage to me — nothing wild. But the setting? Gorgeous. The interior was beautiful, serene, and designed to make you forget about the world outside. They let me choose my massage oil, and I ended up going with a blend — a mix of all the scents, which felt symbolic of my experience in Bali so far: vibrant, earthy, and hard to pin down. Lemongrass stood out as a favorite — it’s everywhere here, in the food, the drinks, the oils — and I can’t get enough of it.
                    
                    Later, I made my way to a local spot for Luwak coffee. Now, if you’ve never heard of Luwak coffee, buckle up. It’s known as the most expensive coffee in the world, and its production is… unconventional. It’s made from coffee beans that have been eaten and partially digested by the Asian palm civet, a small nocturnal animal locally known as a luwak. The beans ferment as they pass through the luwak’s digestive system, then are collected from the droppings, cleaned, roasted, and brewed into what’s considered a smoother, less acidic cup of coffee. Wild, right?
                    
                    We toured the family-run garden where the coffee is made. It was lush and insane in the best way — filled with everything from turmeric and cacao to passion fruit and coconut. I got to meet the luwak in person (adorably sleepy), and see how traditional Balinese architecture shapes the family compound — open-air pavilions, stone shrines, and ornate carvings that reflect generations of heritage.
                    
                    After the tour, came the tasting. And wow. They brought out a whole flight of over 15 drinks — teas, herbal blends, avocado coffee, coconut coffee, cacao, and more. I was honestly blown away. The local cacao stood out: rich, pure, and almost creamy. 
                    
                    To end the day, I visited Tirta Empul, a sacred water temple known for its purification ceremonies. Surrounded by temple spires and jungle, I joined others from all over the world in the ritual. You move from fountain to fountain, letting the water wash over you as part of a spiritual cleansing. It was peaceful and grounding — a powerful reminder of how travel connects us not just to places, but to deeper, shared human experiences.
                    
                    Driving back through Bali, I passed rice fields, jungle canopies, and — no surprise — temples on almost every corner. There’s something incredibly special about this island. Maybe it’s the way tradition, nature, and everyday life blend together. Maybe it’s the lemongrass. Whatever it is, I’m soaking it in. </p>

            <h3>Thursday, June 5th, Bali, Indonesia</h3>
            
                <p>I arrived to Bali, Indonesia late last night. I had a long travel day to think about various business ideas and endeavors. One could argue that Bali is the most popular tourist destination on planet earth. When starting my trip Bali and Indonesia as a whole was not even on my radar. I wanted to avoid too touristy places and muslim countries. Indonesia does not recognize Israeli passports so I had moral qualms to even go to the country. After doing some of my own research into the history, culture and popularity of the place I decided to come. First thing that I had no idea until a three months ago is that Bali is 90% Hindu. Since I loved Nepal and Hindu culture this really enticed me. There was early Indian influence in Bali from the 1st to the 5th century and powerful Hindu kingdoms were established here later on. Also, Balinese culture and Hinduism is unique. They have their own language, traditional dress, and architecture. Aside from the unique culture Bali is most well known for the party scene and surfing. Since I am retired from partying I will be avoiding the party trap. I started off my Bali experience in a town called Ubud. Ubud is know for the traditional spiritual hub of Bali. Driving in late at night I already saw many temples and Hindu sculptures. I have been here less than 8 hours, only 2 of them have I been awake, and it already feels quite peaceful and unique. I need to go explore the town some. While in Ubud I look forward to hitting the gym, sauna, cold plunge, getting some massages, experiencing the temples here, and seeing some nice nature.</p>

            <h3>Tuesday, June 3rd, Siargao, Phillipines</h3>
            
                <p>Last day in the Philippines.
                    It has been a nice month—relaxing, snorkeling, and surfing. This morning I rented a new board and went to Cloud 9. The break was big, strong, and powerful. I saw powerful, hollow barrels for the first time in my life. The only problem is how crowded it is—30 to 50 people all fighting for one wave, with the locals yelling at you to move out of the way. It can get dangerous.
                    
                    I like flowriding and wake surfing since you're all alone and the wave is consistent every time. Surfing, on the other hand, is different each day. Sometimes the waves are mushy, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes large. You need a different board depending on the wave. There’s probably a metaphor in there somewhere.
                    
                    In the past, and for most Americans, people like clear paths—nothing out of the ordinary, no disruptions. They like seeing exactly what they're going to get—no questions needed. This is like flowriding or wake surfing: you know what to expect, everything is planned for you, all you have to do is subscribe.
                    
                    Surfing throws all of your expectations out the window. You must adapt to different scenarios. You can’t use the same technique every day. You have to learn to be dynamic. Being dynamic is the best way to live. Too many people think they’re a certain way and never change. The beauty of life is adapting and changing yourself continually.
                    
                    A friend recently told me that all the people we went to high school with have already graduated medical school. They’ve been on the path since freshman year of high school. That’s analogous to flowriding or wake surfing—get on the wave, it's clear, with relatively defined instructions, and don’t stray.
                    
                    Surfing through life is studying electrical engineering, quitting, becoming a backpacker rasta, and then having no idea what to do next! That being said, if you go too deep into backpacker rasta mode, you risk losing your intellectuality. I’m ready to ignite my intellect and create something great. I want to connect with more life surfers and fewer flowriders. I want to create and do cool shit—and I want to see others doing the same. After surfing, I went to a class with Mochi, who I did aero yoga with for the first time a couple of days ago. The class was hips and abs, but since I was the only one there, he gave me a personalized session. He told me about the importance of dynamic stretching and weighted stretching. He mentioned how yoga is nice but doesn’t provide long-term relief for men who build muscle and get tighter than women. It was an interesting point. He said that usually the muscle itself is quite loose, but the fascia around the muscle gets super tight. You must do stretches that break up fascia. He taught me handstand basics and how to be safe. I’ll practice my handstand in Indonesia.

                    Mochi is from Colorado but moved to Bali and now Siargao, teaching calisthenics and acro yoga and trying to become an international entrepreneur.
                    
                    I talked with another friend about whether work should be a means to an end or a flaming passion. I’m still unsure what the right answer is. You probably need a healthy mix of both in life.
                    
                    As I prepare for Indonesia and also for my eventual return to the U.S., I’m taking stock of where I’m at. I think I’m a new person, for sure—with new values and new learnings. I feel like the software update from this trip is 85% complete.
                    
                    In Indonesia, I’ll continue to work on eating healthy, really focus on my stretching and making my body feel good, research things that interest me and ignite my intellect, stay retired from partying and drinking, and just be more open to life.
                    
                    Excited to see what the future holds—and hopefully I get a little lost along the way!</p>
