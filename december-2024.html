            <h2>Wednesday December 18th 2024, Bangkok, Thailand</h2>
            
            <p>Today was a nice day. I woke up and packed my bags to head to Thailand. I spent the morning reading my new book, The Black Tulip and had a nice breakfast at 4stories. Around noon I met up with Maya and Shantel, two Israeli girls who were taking the same flight as me to Bangkok. Yesterday I went to donate my needed stuff to Chabad where there is a pile of used trekking gear for people to take. While I was there I ran into Maya and Shantel and we found out we were on the same flight to Thailand. So today we met up and shared a taxi to the airport, it was super cheap. They spent a whole 2 months in Nepal! Israelis really love to travel super slow and soak in the whole culture. At the airport I reunited with Zach we went to India for a 48 hour trip. The flight to Thailand was a brief 3.5 hours. When we landed we went to a convenience store and got seaweed snacks. It was nice being back in East Asia since my Japan trip a year ago with nice convenience store snacks. We took a 45 minute taxi to our hostel in the city center. After dropping off our bags Zach and I got mango sticky rice at a restaurant called Myth, recommended by my friend Kyle. At the ATM I took out some cash and somehow misplaced my debit card. I hope I can get a new one shipped here. After dinner we walked the streets of the place Khao San road. This place was consumption and a tourist zoo. Super load clubs blaring music, people trying to sell you random shit, and tons of food stalls. Also in Thailand weed is legal and you can just rip bong or smoke a J anywhere. I did not realize this. The street was a little much and kind of disgusting seeing how much filth and partying was going on. On this trip I have rarely gone out or drank so it was weird seeing so many westerners go out of their way just to smoke or party. I can see why the Hangover was set in Bangkok. After walking this famous street we headed back to our hostel to rest. Looking forward to exploring the real parts of the city tomorrow. </p>

            <h2>Tuesday December 17th 2024, Kathmandu, Nepal</h2>
            
            <p>Well today is my last day in Nepal. A total of three weeks filled with many learnings and memories. Nepal is one of my favorite countries I have ever visited and I recommend it to everyone. The people are friendly, the nature is beautiful and the culture is unique. Here are some key takeaways from my three weeks in the Himalayan gem. 1. Urban planning must be resilient for future urbanization. The narrow streets here are slammed with motorcycles and cars. The city is unable to handle the boom in urbanization. People around the globe will continue to move to city centers for opportunities so it’s essential our city infrastructure can handle the expected growth. 2. Variety of food options is healthy. There is not much variety here and it made me grateful for the plethora of cuisine in the US. 3. Don’t take a warm shower and toilet paper for granted 4. Warm weather makes me feel more alive/energized. It is harder to workout in the cold. 5. Need to do our part in minimizing pollution/littering/global warming, it is a big and growing issue. 6. Paved roads are an amazing invention. Also today I was able to get an hour massage at seeing hands. Seeing hands is a massage studio which employs blind people. In Asia, the tradition of blind masseur is centuries old. It is well known that their increased sense of perception and touch makes them ideally suited for massage therapists. On my travels I have ran across this place and a coffee shop in Africa which employs deaf people. I think this type of business is great for awareness and giving people with disabilities opportunities to be social and work. In the US I have never heard of such a concept and it seems that we just try to hide our disabled citizens and are ashamed. Many of these people are amazing individuals with great talents to lend a hand to. Also today I tried a tablespoon of mad honey in my tea while reading. Mad honey is a rare and potent honey derived from the nectar of Rhododendron flowers, which contain natural neurotoxins. It is praised for its medicinal properties and psychoactive effects. I felt alert and a little etheric. It was cool trying a local product straight from the Himalayas. Tomorrow I fly to Bangkok Thailand for the next leg of the journey. I have been wanting to go to Thailand for a while so I am excited to relax on the beach, train Muay Thai, and explore. </p>

            <h2>Monday December 16th 2024, Kathmandu, Nepal</h2>
            
            <p>Sometimes it is overlooked the less glamorous parts of traveling, which is traveling itself. Today I took a 10 hour bus ride from Pokhara back to Kathmandu. I booked the nicer bus with plushy seats and reclining for a couple extra bucks but it still made the transit pretty brutal. The bus took off at 7:30 in the morning and arrived in Kathmandu around 16:30. Traveling these long distances and for a long time really tests your patience. First I was told I could not recline my seat back which was annoying but not the end of the world. The Nepali guy sitting next to me decided to play his Tik Tok feed out loud for a solid thirty minutes. He also was man spreading and had his arms and legs all over me, despite being 5 foot 3. I pride myself on my patience but I did not want to deal with it anymore so I decided to move to the back of the bus. In the back of the bus the seats are more stiff so I had to roll with the punches. A couple minutes later a kid in front of me starts vomiting vigorously and audibly. At this point I just surrendered and tried to rest. I could not rest because my mind was exploring thoughts of life. Another aspect which made the trip pretty brutal was that the roads in Nepal are rarely paved. The entirety of the ride was so bumpy. At times I even got airborne from the large bumps. I was relieved to make it back to Kathmandu tonight. I felt emotional because it was the final step to complete the trek. I retrieved my bags from the trek company and relished in the busy streets of Kathmandu. I have enjoyed taking the past few days very slowly, not spending much money and recuperating after the trek and before a busy time in Thailand. Tomorrow is my last day in the great country of Nepal. Hopefully I can workout and get a massage. </p>

            <h2>Sunday December 15th 2024, Pokhara, Nepal</h2>
            
            <p>Cycles. Today was exhausting and rejuvenating at the same time. I walked the streets of Pokhara for hours, thinking. I felt particularly emotional today and meditated on the concept emotional intelligence. Modern society, especially the younger generation, lacks emotional intelligence. So the question lies, how does one curate and enhance their emotional intelligence. In school we are taught how to sharpen cognitive intelligence, but there is nothing taught about emotional intelligence. The answer can be found in knowing how to navigate the cycles of the heart and mind. People always say that they want happiness in life as their main goal. I am here to tell you that is one of the lowest understandings of life. If anything you should make a goal of sadness! The reason is that it is impossible to be happy all the time due to the cycles of life, creation, and nature. When you orient yourself this way your whole perspective changes. Now, when you are not at your 100%, you can learn to masterfully surf the downward cycle. If you learn how to surf this wave instead of letting a tsunami crash over you and bring you to the bottom of the ocean, you are well ahead of many in the world. This relates to my trip of course. Some may think that when you quit your job and travel the world you are on cloud nine 24/7. For a part of this trip I even thought that was possible. This is of course not possible due to, you know it, cycles. So now, curating your emotional intelligence when you are going through the cycles of life is not easy. It takes time, thought, patience and pain. The best way to enhance your emotional intelligence, and effectively understand yourself better, is reflect upon the entirety of your life. Try to understand how thought patterns got created, how emotional tendencies came to be, who influenced you throughout your path. Once you understand the patterns that shape you, you can either, lean into them more if you like the emotional and cognitive tendencies you have created, or shatter them completely. Few people realize that you can completely reengineer your psyche on a daily basis if you have the emotional intelligence to do so. This is an extremely powerful tool. For example, today I had emotions and thoughts that were overwhelming and difficult. I inspected them deeper to try and understand where it was coming from. To be honest I truly do not know where this whirlwind of emotions came from, so I decided to go deeper into it. It was painful and uncomfortable in the moment. I have sharpened my cognitive intelligence to a significant degree throughout my life and travels, but sometimes the emotions supersedes cognition. Sometimes you cannot put into words or intellectualization of the emotions you are feeling and why they are coming up. Many people do themselves a disservice by constricting their emotions to words and cognitive philosophy. You literally constrict the amount you can feel and experience by doing this. When you are overwhelmed and your cognitive skills reach a dead end, you fasten your seat belt, put on your big boy pants and go for a ride. If you do not have the focus, vigor, and strength to do this, you either get sunk by the wave or you hide all your emotions in a storage box, thinking it will go away. However, they will only bubble and manifest in a more painful way later on. It could be argued suppressing your emotions is even worse than getting sunk by them because suppressing slowly eats away at you and creates unwanted physical and psychological tendencies you are unaware of. Then when you attempt to do this exercise with a storage box of emotions you have no idea where your emotional patterns come from because you tried to stuff it in a dark corner. This will be much more painful I guarantee. So now you know how to sharpen your emotional intelligence. When the going gets tough you must breathe deeper into your being and let go of unwanted cycles. Creation is ruled by cycles that we are so unaware of. The tides, the moon, the sun, and so much more. In the afternoon Zach told me it is the last full moon of the year today. This moon will rise the most far north it has in the last 18.6 years. This is yet another example of the closing of a natural cycle and the start of a new one. These times are crucial for self evolution. Don’t you want your emotional and cognitive cycles to be in tune with the greater creation? Thinking about cycles made me reflect on the masculine and feminine aspects of creation as well. Note, this is about masculine and feminine, not male and female per se. The feminine energy is much more privy to cycles. This is most obviously seen through a woman’s period cycles and the cycles of pregnancy. Now connecting this to emotional intelligence, what does this say about the feminine aspect inside everyone? The feminine aspect of creation is delicate, and susceptible to the cycles of life. Sometimes the feminine wants one thing on one day, and a completely different thing the next day. The feminine is like a garden which needs to be carefully tended to. This is in contrast to the masculine energy, which is steadfast and decisive. The masculine energy sets the direction and shows the feminine garden how beautifully it can grow. That being said the masculine is not as in tune with the cycles of nature and life. The reason I am exploring the masculine and feminine energies so deeply is because they are fundamental aspects of creation and therefore are essential to understand to increase emotional intelligence. When you frame the world and yourself this way many things become clear. Part of being emotionally intelligent means not trying to change the forces of nature. One must understand the feminine for what it is and the function it plays, same for the masculine. With all this in mind, it is obvious to keep cycles in the forefront of your awareness if possible. I think I grew today, by diving deeper into my emotional intelligence and taking the time to myself to walk and think. It is still very difficult at times but I hope to continue to evolve into my truest self.  </p>

            <h2>Wednesday December 11th 2024, Pokhara, Nepal</h2>
            
            <p> This is a recount of Monday December 9th 2024, one of the most challenging days of my life. Today I woke up at 3AM to trek through the Thorong La Pass: elevation of 5,416 m (17,769 ft). I slept in all my layers, base layer, fleece, windbreaker, down jacket, two pairs of socks, so I did not have to fumble around putting on clothes early this morning. I woke up with a slight headache due to the altitude. The starting altitude was 4500m. I put on my head lamp and went to the dining area to have a black tea and Tibetan bread. I was scared how my stomach would react so I did not eat that much. We started the trek around 4AM and it was pitch black dark. It was -17 degrees Fahrenheit. I did not even think of the cold because I was trying to fight off my headache. The stars were numerous and so bright. The first two hours was straight uphill. As the altitude increased breathing became harder and my heart rate accelerated. I only could see two feet in front of me due to the darkness and focused on going forward slowly. After five steps I would have to take a break and was huffing and puffing. I felt dizzy. My heart felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. I was nervous I would pass out and roll down the side of the cliff. One wrong step or slip on a rock could send you rolling thousands of meters to death. Every time I needed a sip of water it was frozen and I had to exert so much effort to unfreeze it. The sun started peaking over the mountain just at the second half of the leg, around 6:45 am. For a second I thought I was going to be stuck in perpetual darkness and realized how thankful I am for the sunlight. At the halfway mark we stopped in a closed teahouse to shield ourselves from the wind. At this point it was probably -25 degrees Fahrenheit. I had hand warmers but my thumbs felt numb and like they were about to fall off. I was dizzy and my stomach was churning, I thought I would throw up or pass out any second. We took a nice long break in the closed tea house before starting the next leg. The second half was just as hard due to the increasing altitude. Now I would take five steps and had to stop. I tried to calm my heart and breathe. In the mountains everything is so quiet, you can hear your neuron synapsis. Every time we made it over a hill I thought we were finished, but it seemed to never end. The last thirty minutes I literally was taking one step every three seconds. When I reached the top it was a relief. We took some pictures at the 5416m (17,769 feet) peak of the world’s largest pass. We thought it was time to celebrate but then we had to trek another four hours downhill to lunch. After being so gassed that was the last thing I wanted to hear. It started snowing on the back side of the mountain and the snow would get into my clothing making me cold and shiver. It hurt my knees going downhill. I couldn’t believe we needed to trek more after the four most excruciating hours of my life. Horses passed us on the way and I never wanted to ride a horse more. After a very long four hours downhill we made it to lunch. It was nice sitting in a local place to rest and eat. The host made a fire and we ate simply. I reflected how simple humans can be. After lunch we had one more hour trek. It was snowing hard and windy but we had to power through. We stopped by Muktinath temple and finally made it back to society. Unfortunately at the hotel the electricity was broken so that meant no shower or running water. This was one of the most difficult experiences of my life and I am happy we did it. When I was hating the trek my mind took me to warm places and places of love. I hadn’t had a good shower or clean clothes in a week and a half. This trek pushed me to my limits. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in the moment but it all fades away after. When you do hard things it is important to tell yourself the pain is only temporary. </p>

            <h2>Wednesday December 11th 2024, Pokhara, Nepal</h2>
            
            <p> Today marks the end of the 11-day Annapurna Circuit Trek. The total distance trekked was about 150 km (93 miles), and the total elevation gain was about 4,116 m (13,504 ft).

                The past week and a half has been one of the craziest experiences of my life. Trekking through the Himalayas, tea house to tea house, gave me new perspectives and a deep appreciation for life. It will be really difficult to encapsulate the entire experience in words, but I will try.
                
                Each morning, Zach and I woke up around 7 AM and had breakfast. We enjoyed Tibetan bread and ginger-lemon-honey tea. We would trek for about four hours in the morning through dramatic landscapes and mountain towns. Around noon, we ate lunch and rested before trekking another 2–3 hours in the afternoon. Each night, we stayed in local mountain towns and tea houses. It was the off-season, so we were typically the only people there. We spent our evenings playing cards, laughing, and relaxing.
                
                Each day of the trek became progressively harder with the increasing altitude. For so many hours of the day, I was alone with my thoughts. The silence of the mountains was deafening. I thought about the future, the present, and occasionally the past.
                
                The entire trek climaxed on the last day, crossing the Thorong La Pass, with a maximum elevation of 5,416 m (17,769 ft). I will give a full recap of the last day in a later post.
                
                During the first few days, I wrote these takeaways:
                
                One shift in your mindset changes your whole perspective.
                Patience is key.
                You can’t rush to the top; “slowly, slowly” is the mantra for acclimatization. You can have everything—just not all at once.
                There are infinite ways to reach the top.
                I love the sound of running water.
                Nothing beats fresh air.
                Fire, a hot shower, AC, and toilet paper are incredible inventions.
                Find a balance between the present and the future.
                Tea culture is wonderful.
                Overall, it was an unforgettable experience. It was painful and uncomfortable at times, but incredibly rewarding. I’m not jumping with excitement to do another intense trek anytime soon, but I believe it will call me again in the future. </p>
