            <h3>Thursday, May 1st, Singapore, Singapore</h3>
            
            <p>Travel day to Singapore! I arrived in Singapore this afternoon safely and smoothly. 
                Let’s recap the history and current state of the rich city-state before my two-night exploration here! Once a humble Malay fishing village known as Temasek, Singapore’s transformation began in 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company established it as a strategic free port, quickly turning the island into a vital hub for global trade. 
                Through the 19th and early 20th centuries, it flourished under British colonial rule until it faced Japanese occupation during World War II, a traumatic chapter that lasted from 1942 to 1945. After the war, Singapore moved toward self-governance in 1959 and briefly joined Malaysia in 1963, only to be expelled two years later, forcing the fledgling nation into sudden independence in 1965. What followed was one of the most remarkable development stories of the modern world: under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore built a highly efficient, corruption-free government, emphasized education and urban planning, and opened its doors to foreign investment, becoming a global powerhouse in finance, technology, and shipping despite having almost no natural resources. Today, Singapore is a tightly woven fabric of cultures, shaped by its rich ethnic mosaic made up of roughly 75% Chinese, 15% Malay, 7% Indian, and a remaining 3% comprising Eurasians and other minority groups. This diversity is reflected in everything from its cuisine and architecture to its festivals and neighborhoods, with English as the main working language alongside widespread use of Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, and the colorful local slang known as Singlish. After the flight I took the clean and efficient public transport about 30 minutes to my hostel in Little India. The crazy thing about Singapore is how expensive it is—hostel beds in an 18-person dorm room are over 40 dollars a night! This high cost of living is part of Singapore’s broader economic story: despite its small size and lack of natural resources, it has become one of the world’s richest countries thanks to strategic planning, pro-business policies, and an emphasis on global trade and finance. Its GDP stands at over $500 billion USD, with a GDP per capita of around $85,000, making it one of the wealthiest nations globally. Singapore’s key exports include electronics, pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, and financial services, and it's home to one of the busiest ports and airports in the world. My first impressions of Singapore are overwhelmingly positive—it’s instantly likable and captivating. The country is a fascinating fusion of some of my favorite cultural influences—Asian and Indian—wrapped in a sleek, ultra-modern, and first-world presentation. It is immaculately clean, feels incredibly safe, and signs warning of hefty fines for everything from littering to fighting are posted everywhere, reinforcing its reputation for strict order. In Little India, the streets pulse with life: rows of electronic shops, barbershops, clothing stalls, and clusters of young men chatting in Tamil give the area the feel of southern India transplanted into the heart of Southeast Asia. One thing I realized is that for a country to succeed, it must find a way to attract and retain global capital—both the wealthy and the financial institutions that support them. Singapore is a masterclass in this strategy: its low corporate tax rates (around 17%), lack of capital gains tax, robust legal protections, political stability, and streamlined regulations have made it a magnet for multinational banks, investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals. This is a model that countries like Vietnam—despite their growing economic momentum—should look to emulate if they want to elevate themselves further on the world stage. After settling in, I looked up the famous hawker center in Little India for cheap, authentic Indian food. I had really good mutton biryani—tender, spicy, and deeply flavorful. Hawker centers are a uniquely Singaporean institution: open-air food courts packed with individual vendors, or “hawkers,” who specialize in just one or two dishes perfected over years or even generations. They’re an affordable, communal way for locals and tourists alike to enjoy the city’s multicultural cuisine, and many stalls have even earned Michelin recognition. After a satisfying dinner, I walked back to the hostel to get a good night’s rest before a long and action-packed day tomorrow.</p>
