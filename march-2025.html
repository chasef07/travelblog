            <h3>March 9th 2025, Kampot, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> Why is Kampot super cute? This morning I left the gem of an island, Koh Rong, after 1 week. I spent 2 whole weeks on the Cambodian Islands of Koh Sdach and Koh Rong and it was magical. There are even more islands I did not explore like Koh Rong Sanloem and Koh Ta Kiev. I felt like 2 weeks on the islands was a good amount of time, even though I could have easily spent more time. I only have a 1 month visa and wanted to balance out the beach with actually experiencing Cambodian culture. I rarely say this but Koh Rong is a place I want to come back to in my life. Typically on my travels I do not gravitate to a place to the extent I feel the need to come back. However, Koh Rong, Long Beach, and Koh Touch have my heart. I took a two hour speedboat catamaran to the port city of Kampot. I arrived having no clue what there is to do in this city. Backpackers sometimes overlook Kampot but I felt like it was necessary to go see a real Cambodian city. Kampot is home to one of the world’s finest peppers, known for its rich aroma and flavor. It has a Geographical Indication (GI) status, like Champagne in France. Kampot also has huge salt fields to explore as well. Upon entering the port the first thing I noticed was women in hijabs riding scooters. I have not seen any muslims in SE Asia so it made me research why I saw so many here. Muslims in Kampot belong to the Cham ethnic group, who have lived in the region for centuries. They are descendants of the ancient Champa Kingdom, which once thrived in now central and southern Vietnam. When the Vietnamese conquered the Champa, many Cham migrated to Cambodia. During the Khmer Rouge era (1975-1979), the Cham population faced severe persecution. However they persevered and thrive here in Kampot. See I already learned more about Cambodia than I have the past two weeks. Also I noticed Kampot attracts the older western men, similar to Don Det Laos. I think it is due to good warm weather, and cheapness. The hostel I am at is 5 dollars a night. I opted to treat myself to falafel and hummus plate for 12 dollar dinner, which is very expensive for Kampot. I will tone it down tomorrow. Any way as I always do, I walked the city first thing. I was a little pessimistic at first, but then I reached the coast and it was so beautiful. There are tons of viber cafes and walking streets and nice restaurants. I also found a sauna and cold plunge place right by my hostel! You know that is getting hit tomorrow. So why is Kampot super cute? Honestly I have been really impressed with Cambodian cities. The viber cafes and modern infrastructure you can argue surpasses parts of Thailand. I asked ChatGPT why Kampot is super cute and here is what it says: Kampot is super cute because it has a laid-back riverside charm, French colonial architecture, and a creative, artsy vibe. It’s a mix of old-world charm, backpacker energy, and Cambodian culture. French colonialism in Cambodia was part of French Indochina, which included Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. France controlled Cambodia from 1863 to 1953, shaping its politics, economy, and infrastructure while also preserving the monarchy. In 1863, King Norodom signed a protectorate agreement with France to avoid being taken over by Thailand (Siam) or Vietnam. In 1887, Cambodia was officially merged into French Indochina along with Vietnam.The French allowed Cambodia to keep its royal family, but real power was in the hands of French officials. During World War II, Japan briefly occupied Cambodia (1941–1945), weakening French control.After the war, Cambodian nationalists & King Norodom Sihanouk pushed for independence. In 1953, France finally granted Cambodia full independence without a war, unlike Vietnam’s long fight for freedom. Fascinating right? I also researched the Nazi occupation of Tunisia today and the concentration camps throughout Tunisia. I met an Israeli yesterday whose family came from Tunisia and fled the Holocaust. I never knew the Nazis invaded Tunisia or set of labor camps there. I would write about it here but you should research it yourself. Okay that was long. Overall Cambodia has really surprised me. I am going to use every day of my visa here. I look forward to vibing in Kampot a few days! </p>

            <h3>March 8th 2025, Koh Rong, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> Wake up. Order a mango passion fruit shake for a buck twenty-five. Walk shoeless to the gym in a bathing suit and no shirt. Workout hard for an hour. Protein shake. Take my motorbike, no shoes or shirt, to the most beautiful beach I’ve seen, Long Beach. Order a coconut and some lunch. Read, stretch, swim. This has been my mornings in the beautiful island of Koh Rong. I love this place and this routine. It leaves me energized, happy, and grateful. On Thursday everyplace was booked through the weekend. People come to Koh Rong for the weekend to party. Since I have effectively retired from partying since Thailand I have been able to completely avoid alcohol and the party scene for the beautiful routine I have described. Now I mentioned everyplace was booked on Hostelworld, on booking.com, and when I asked around town everyone was booked. This is the backpackers dilemma. Not planning too much in advance but still getting what you want. I spent Thursday walking around for two hours searching for a place. I found a place for one night. I didn’t want to leave Koh Rong yet so I searched for another place Friday night and succeeded. The owner said I’d have to leave Saturday because there was no space. I was prepared to go to another island. I woke up today prepared to checkout and leave but he told me I could stay! This is the beauty of backpacking. You don’t know what tomorrow will look like, but it will be beautiful. So instead of leaving to the other island I was able to stay another night. Maybe I will leave tomorrow or maybe I won’t! I am in the best shape of my life because I walk so much and workout a lot. I hope to never own a car again. In Dallas I drove so much. It’s so bad for your posture and your health. Walking barefoot and shirtless everywhere is so awesome. It feels primitive and good. </p>

            <h3>March 6th 2025, Koh Rong, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> I want to recount one of the best days of my life. Tuesday March 4th 2025. First I want to tell you about some of my internal findings. I grew up in Tampa Bay Florida, near the water, where beach and fish culture thrives. I would have never described myself as a beach or fishing boy, always choosing to play sports in the park more. I always viewed my brother as much more of a salty beach boy than me. Being here in Koh Rong, walking barefoot, drinking fresh fruit shakes and coconuts, eating seafood, has made me realize how much the ocean shaped my upbringing and impacts me today. I think people who are raised in warm beach climates are built different: more down to earth, active, and well rounded. So, even though growing up I never realized the impact of the beach and ocean had on me, I feel it in my veins now. I love waking up in the morning and going to swim in the sea. I love walking around barefoot. I love working out outdoors at the gym or beach. I love eating fresh coconuts and fruits and fish. I realized that living in big urban city is one of the worst things you can do as a human for your mind, body and soul. I hope to never live in an urban city again. It must be a smaller place surrounded by nature, beach or mountains. Side note about coconut water: Coconut water is nature’s sports drink, packed with electrolytes, hydration benefits, and essential nutrients. It’s low in calories and sugar compared to most commercial sports drinks, making it a great natural option. Coconut water is rich in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. One cup of coconut water has more potassium than a banana. Coconut water is one of the best natural drinks for hydration, heart health, digestion, and recovery. Just choose pure, unsweetened versions for the best benefits. Wow coco’s are the best. I also realized how much sugar is in drinks and food in the US. Ok now about Tuesday. I woke up and had coffee and a small breakfast at an Italian coffee shop. I FaceTimed my friend Jacob and we updated each other on life. Around noon I met up with Wisdom, a local Cambodian. I bought mushrooms from him to take on the beach this afternoon. Mushrooms are not a drug, they are a tool for radical self improvement, reflection and learning. I am not ashamed to tell my blog readers I have taken mushrooms because they have made me a more caring, loving, compassionate, and focused human. If anyone is looking to understand and grow themselves more I highly recommend trying. Rachel and I drove our scooter to the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in my life, Long Beach. The water is crystal clear, the sand super white and squeaky, and the beach goes on for a long time on a beautiful cove surrounded by jungle mountains. We dropped our scooter off in some bushes and walked. We came across a beautiful piece of beach where many Israelis were chilling there. It was literally a secret Israeli beach! We sat and talked and laughed and cried. It is crazy how many layers of your ego, of your self, there are. We are all so ignorant as to what shaped us to who we are today. The human psyche is like an onion, and you can go infinitely far to explore why the way you are. It takes real hard inner work. In the end, understanding your self on a deeper level makes you more loving, understanding, and strong. We talked about learning from our parents, how the cycle of life is beautiful. How grandparents teach their children who teach their children. I wish to build a beautiful family one day and teach my children all that I have learned.I thought about the fragility of life, the importance of health. I gained so much perspective and clarity. I am so grateful for my life, my parents my friends. I am grateful for my travels. Sometimes I get numb to the experiences and do not realize how amazing they are. It gave me perspective on how beautiful my life and travels are and the path I am on. I pride myself on being a good listener, to being a faithful and trustworthy friend. I wish to be more loving and tell the people I care about I love them more. The infinite love energy force floored me. This you can call G-D, you can call it whatever you want. It knows no religion, no boundaries, and is pure oneness. I laughed I cried and I swam. I saw the most beautiful sunset. After everything was said and done I drove the scooter back in the dark down the craziest road and hills. I realized and internalized the importance of talking about thoughts in words to understand them deeper. Share it verbally with people to really make an impact on yourself. I learned this from Chassidus but did not internalize it until now. I could say so much more but this is a glimpse. I love you! </p>

            <h3>March 6th 2025, Koh Rong, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> I am currently in Koh Rong, Cambodia, the main island of Cambodia. It is without a doubt one of my favorite, maybe my favorite place of my whole travels. I have been here for 5 days, barely on my phone, walking with no shoes, and drinking fresh coconuts. I am going to give a recap of my first day here, Sunday March 2nd and will give updates of the rest of the time in another post. On Sunday I arrived in Koh Rong and went to a beautiful beach, named Lonely Beach, secluded on the north end of the island from everything. There is only one bungalow/bar/restaurant there. Rachel and I did not book any accommodation and were lucky that the Lonely Beach owner had a dorm room available. We slept outside on a wooden platform with 6 other beds. It was really cool sleeping out in the jungle on the beach so removed from everything. At night we swam with bioluminescent plankton. I have seen these plankton before in Florida but here it was so beautiful and amazing. These glowing organisms are a type of marine plankton, specifically dinoflagellates—tiny, single-celled algae. They use a chemical reaction to produce light, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence. The plankton contain an enzyme called luciferase and a molecule called luciferin.
                When the plankton are disturbed, the enzyme reacts with oxygen and luciferin.
                This reaction releases energy in the form of a blue-green glow, which is most visible in dark surroundings. Nature is so damn cool. I really enjoyed going straight to lonely beach away from all the main action. We drove a motorbike there and it was extremely hard to reach, making it even more special. The owner of the lonely beach bungalows was an old French guy born with extremely loose hips. He moved here 15 years ago, speaks fluent Cambodian, and wanted to do something he loves and caress about. The restaurant he has is really good too. I think this island is still in its infancy and would be a great place to invest. </p>
