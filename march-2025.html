            <h3>March 1st 2025, Koh Sdach, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> I am in a small fishing island off the southwest of Cambodia. Nobody came to this island until a hostel chain, Mad Monkey, opened a beautiful hostel. It is more of a resort. For 8 dollars a night it includes a sauna, steam room, cold plunge, jazuzzi, infinity pool, outdoor gym, private beach, and comfy beds. It opened a month ago. I rushed here to get into a nice routine, relax, and unwind. As you know I love saunas and cold plunges. I have taken the past couple of days to disconnect and improve my mind and body. Yesterday I went out on a boat with people from the hostel and we banana boated and fished. It was a lot of fun. I am very proud to announce that I am a part of the flip on community or flipper community. I learned how to do a backflip from the boat! I never thought I would be a flipper but I was able to do it pretty easily on my first try. Another tool to my tool belt. I also learned that I like Flat White coffee. I never heard of this type of coffee in the US. A flat white is an espresso-based coffee drink made with a shot (or double shot) of espresso and steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of microfoam (smooth, velvety milk foam). It originated in Australia or New Zealand and is known for its strong coffee flavor and silky texture. Essentially, if you prefer a bolder coffee taste with a creamy texture, go for a flat white. If you like a milkier, smoother drink, a latte is a better choice. I will be chilling in Koh Sdach for another couple of days before moving on to another island of Cambodia. Shabbat Shalom. </p>
