            <h3>March 8th 2025, Koh Rong, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> Wake up. Order a mango passion fruit shake for a buck twenty-five. Walk shoeless to the gym in a bathing suit and no shirt. Workout hard for an hour. Protein shake. Take my motorbike, no shoes or shirt, to the most beautiful beach I’ve seen, Long Beach. Order a coconut and some lunch. Read, stretch, swim. This has been my mornings in the beautiful island of Koh Rong. I love this place and this routine. It leaves me energized, happy, and grateful. On Thursday everyplace was booked through the weekend. People come to Koh Rong for the weekend to party. Since I have effectively retired from partying since Thailand I have been able to completely avoid alcohol and the party scene for the beautiful routine I have described. Now I mentioned everyplace was booked on Hostelworld, on booking.com, and when I asked around town everyone was booked. This is the backpackers dilemma. Not planning too much in advance but still getting what you want. I spent Thursday walking around for two hours searching for a place. I found a place for one night. I didn’t want to leave Koh Rong yet so I searched for another place Friday night and succeeded. The owner said I’d have to leave Saturday because there was no space. I was prepared to go to another island. I woke up today prepared to checkout and leave but he told me I could stay! This is the beauty of backpacking. You don’t know what tomorrow will look like, but it will be beautiful. So instead of leaving to the other island I was able to stay another night. Maybe I will leave tomorrow or maybe I won’t! I am in the best shape of my life because I walk so much and workout a lot. I hope to never own a car again. In Dallas I drove so much. It’s so bad for your posture and your health. Walking barefoot and shirtless everywhere is so awesome. It feels primitive and good. </p>

            <h3>March 6th 2025, Koh Rong, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> I want to recount one of the best days of my life. Tuesday March 4th 2025. First I want to tell you about some of my internal findings. I grew up in Tampa Bay Florida, near the water, where beach and fish culture thrives. I would have never described myself as a beach or fishing boy, always choosing to play sports in the park more. I always viewed my brother as much more of a salty beach boy than me. Being here in Koh Rong, walking barefoot, drinking fresh fruit shakes and coconuts, eating seafood, has made me realize how much the ocean shaped my upbringing and impacts me today. I think people who are raised in warm beach climates are built different: more down to earth, active, and well rounded. So, even though growing up I never realized the impact of the beach and ocean had on me, I feel it in my veins now. I love waking up in the morning and going to swim in the sea. I love walking around barefoot. I love working out outdoors at the gym or beach. I love eating fresh coconuts and fruits and fish. I realized that living in big urban city is one of the worst things you can do as a human for your mind, body and soul. I hope to never live in an urban city again. It must be a smaller place surrounded by nature, beach or mountains. Side note about coconut water: Coconut water is nature’s sports drink, packed with electrolytes, hydration benefits, and essential nutrients. It’s low in calories and sugar compared to most commercial sports drinks, making it a great natural option. Coconut water is rich in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. One cup of coconut water has more potassium than a banana. Coconut water is one of the best natural drinks for hydration, heart health, digestion, and recovery. Just choose pure, unsweetened versions for the best benefits. Wow coco’s are the best. I also realized how much sugar is in drinks and food in the US. Ok now about Tuesday. I woke up and had coffee and a small breakfast at an Italian coffee shop. I FaceTimed my friend Jacob and we updated each other on life. Around noon I met up with Wisdom, a local Cambodian. I bought mushrooms from him to take on the beach this afternoon. Mushrooms are not a drug, they are a tool for radical self improvement, reflection and learning. I am not ashamed to tell my blog readers I have taken mushrooms because they have made me a more caring, loving, compassionate, and focused human. If anyone is looking to understand and grow themselves more I highly recommend trying. Rachel and I drove our scooter to the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in my life, Long Beach. The water is crystal clear, the sand super white and squeaky, and the beach goes on for a long time on a beautiful cove surrounded by jungle mountains. We dropped our scooter off in some bushes and walked. We came across a beautiful piece of beach where many Israelis were chilling there. It was literally a secret Israeli beach! We sat and talked and laughed and cried. It is crazy how many layers of your ego, of your self, there are. We are all so ignorant as to what shaped us to who we are today. The human psyche is like an onion, and you can go infinitely far to explore why the way you are. It takes real hard inner work. In the end, understanding your self on a deeper level makes you more loving, understanding, and strong. We talked about learning from our parents, how the cycle of life is beautiful. How grandparents teach their children who teach their children. I wish to build a beautiful family one day and teach my children all that I have learned.I thought about the fragility of life, the importance of health. I gained so much perspective and clarity. I am so grateful for my life, my parents my friends. I am grateful for my travels. Sometimes I get numb to the experiences and do not realize how amazing they are. It gave me perspective on how beautiful my life and travels are and the path I am on. I pride myself on being a good listener, to being a faithful and trustworthy friend. I wish to be more loving and tell the people I care about I love them more. The infinite love energy force floored me. This you can call G-D, you can call it whatever you want. It knows no religion, no boundaries, and is pure oneness. I laughed I cried and I swam. I saw the most beautiful sunset. After everything was said and done I drove the scooter back in the dark down the craziest road and hills. I realized and internalized the importance of talking about thoughts in words to understand them deeper. Share it verbally with people to really make an impact on yourself. I learned this from Chassidus but did not internalize it until now. I could say so much more but this is a glimpse. I love you! </p>

            <h3>March 6th 2025, Koh Rong, Cambodia</h3>
            <p> I am currently in Koh Rong, Cambodia, the main island of Cambodia. It is without a doubt one of my favorite, maybe my favorite place of my whole travels. I have been here for 5 days, barely on my phone, walking with no shoes, and drinking fresh coconuts. I am going to give a recap of my first day here, Sunday March 2nd and will give updates of the rest of the time in another post. On Sunday I arrived in Koh Rong and went to a beautiful beach, named Lonely Beach, secluded on the north end of the island from everything. There is only one bungalow/bar/restaurant there. Rachel and I did not book any accommodation and were lucky that the Lonely Beach owner had a dorm room available. We slept outside on a wooden platform with 6 other beds. It was really cool sleeping out in the jungle on the beach so removed from everything. At night we swam with bioluminescent plankton. I have seen these plankton before in Florida but here it was so beautiful and amazing. These glowing organisms are a type of marine plankton, specifically dinoflagellates—tiny, single-celled algae. They use a chemical reaction to produce light, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence. The plankton contain an enzyme called luciferase and a molecule called luciferin.
                When the plankton are disturbed, the enzyme reacts with oxygen and luciferin.
                This reaction releases energy in the form of a blue-green glow, which is most visible in dark surroundings. Nature is so damn cool. I really enjoyed going straight to lonely beach away from all the main action. We drove a motorbike there and it was extremely hard to reach, making it even more special. The owner of the lonely beach bungalows was an old French guy born with extremely loose hips. He moved here 15 years ago, speaks fluent Cambodian, and wanted to do something he loves and caress about. The restaurant he has is really good too. I think this island is still in its infancy and would be a great place to invest. </p>
