            <h3>January 9th 2025, Khao Sok, Thailand</h3>
            <p>Okay chemistry time! I used to be very good at chemistry in high school so this was nostalgic to go through this process. Let’s talk about limestone since the cool cliffs in Khao Sok National Park are made of limestone. Limestone primarily consists of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), thought it can contain other minerals too. In the carbonate ion (CO3)2-, carbon uses sp2 hybridization to form three sigma bonds with oxygen. This means the carbon atom mixes one s orbital and two p atomic orbitals to form three equivalent hybrid orbitals.  Due to this hybridization of the orbitals, the three oxygen atoms are arraigned in a trigonal planar fashion at 120 degrees around the carbon atom. The hybridization allows the carbon atom to form 3 sigma bonds to the oxygens, the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. Next, the carbonate ion exists in a state of resonance, there is not a single, static structure of the ion. Instead, its structure can be represented in three different ways, where the electrons are delocalized over the ion. The electrons are spread out or 'delocalized' over all three oxygen atoms, making all the C-O bonds identical in nature, neither fully single nor fully double but something in between, often described as 1.33 bonds  All C-O bonds are the same length, which is longer than a typical C=O double bond but shorter than a C-O single bond, reflecting their intermediate character. Cool, now this was just about the how carbon bonds to the three oxygen molecules. Next, each oxygen molecule has two lone pairs of electrons. After forming three sigma bonds with its sp2 hybrid orbitals, the carbon atom has one p orbital left that is unhybridized. The unhybridized p orbital on carbon then can overlap with the p orbitals ( the two lone pairs of electrons) of the oxygen atoms. These p orbitals from oxygen and carbon overlap side-to-side (not head-on like sigma bonds), forming pi (π) bonds.The electrons in this unhybridized p orbital, along with the additional electrons from the ion's charge, contribute to a delocalized pi system. This system allows the electrons to resonate across the entire molecule, giving all C-O bonds their partial double bond character.. In summary, sp2 hybridization sets up the geometry and bonding framework for CO₃²⁻, allowing for the formation of a pi system. Resonance is then the phenomenon where the electrons in this pi system are not fixed but are delocalized across the molecule, leading to the observed properties of the carbonate ion. Now calcite is the most common form of limestone. Calcite has a rhombohedral crystal system, specifically a form of trigonal symmetry. Calcite crystallizes in a structure where each calcium ion (Ca²⁺) is surrounded by six oxygen atoms from carbonate ions in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. This is due to the way carbonate anions (CO₃²⁻) are arranged in layers. The bonds in calcite are ionic between calcium and carbonate but covalent as discussed within the carbonate ion. Lastly, the limestone cliffs of Khao Sok can get their beautiful jagged features because Calcite's rhombohedral cleavage can lead to interesting patterns where layers might separate or fracture in a visually appealing manner, especially under the influence of tectonic forces or erosion. Also, the chemical properties driven by the carbonate ion's geometry enable limestone to dissolve in slightly acidic water, forming caves! </p>

            <h3>January 9th 2025, Khao Sok, Thailand</h3>
            <p>I just returned from a 2 day 1 night jungle floating bungalow stay in Khao Sok National Park. I was on a tour with about 60 people where we went on boating safaris, caving, jungle trekking, kayaking and a stay on a floating bungalow. A quick history on the area. Khao Sok is one of the oldest rainforests in the world, dating back 160 million years. The iconic limestone cliffs predate the jungle, dating back around 250 million years. Over time, tectonic movements caused the limestone to uplift above sea level. The formations were shaped into towering cliffs and ridges by geological processes. In the 1980s, the construction of the Ratchaprapha Dam created Cheow Lan Lake within Khao Sok National Park. The dam was built for hydroelectric power generation, and the lake flooded a large valley, submerging forests and lowland areas. I arrived at Cheow Lan Lake and boarded a long boat. The scenes were stunning and I felt like I was in a scene of Avatar. The limestone cliffs were covered in green brush, it made me think about the amazingness of nature and rocks. There is no way this is all entropy, right? In a separate post I am going to explore the chemistry of limestone because I think it is fascinating. We drove around the lake for a while and took a 20 minute pitstop at diamond cave. It was a really dark and authentic cave with nice stalactites and stalagmites. After the cave the group and myself went to check in to our floating bungalows. I stayed in a room with two other solo travelers, Joel from Sweden and Carl from Ireland. The room was tiny and solely had three mattresses on the floor. We got to get to know each other and hopped in the water to cool off. Around 1600 we went to the jungle trek. We saw otters, monkeys, and the biggest spider I have ever seen in my life. It was nice but I was quite tired from a long day in the sun and a shitty night sleep in my hostel. In the evening I ate dinner and chatted with a cool couple, Marcello and Margarita from Northern Italy. They gave me some recommendations such as the Similian Islands in Thailand, where you camp on the beach with a local tribe. Joel also gave me some recommendations about Laos and Cambodia, highlighting a motorbike loop in central Laos and the islands of Koh Rong in Southern Cambodia. After, Carl and I talked about geopolitics, tech, and traveling. Carl is also an electrical engineer who worked at Intel in Ireland, but was fed up with the office life, like me. He quit his job to travel the world for 10 months and found a passion in emergency medicine. We talked about both fields and the lifestyles that come with it. He told me about the history of Ireland which is very interesting. I would like to go to Ireland, but unfortunately they are anti-Israel. I asked him if it was true and he said yes, because Ireland used to be “occupied” they sympathize with the Palestinian cause. Another interesting topic was the EU Apple Ireland Tax Case. Ireland has an outstanding corporate tax of 12.5%, which attracts tons of American companies and tech companies to have European HQs in Ireland.  Ireland is a part of the EU and in 2016 the EU investigated Apple over not paying enough tax to Ireland. The case was Ireland and Apple against the EU. In the end the EU ruled Apple needed to pay Ireland 13 million Euros, even though Ireland was on Apple’s side! Now Ireland does not know what to do or how to distribute the money since they did not even want it! We also talked about Irish pub culture and American sports, it was very nice. I realized and reaffirmed through this I typically connect with older people since they typically have more depth and interesting stories than people my age. In the middle of the night I got up to pee and the sky was covered with the brightest stars I have ever seen. It was so clear and felt so close. Every single spot in the sky had a star, I had never seen the sky so full! In the morning today we woke up early and did another boat safari. We saw some more monkeys and otters. I fly to Chiang Mai Saturday night so will take the next days to chill and prepare for the next leg! </p>

            <h3>January 7th 2025, Khao Sok, Thailand</h3>
            <p> It is time! The second half started today. Zach left for the airport early in the morning. I woke up and said our goodbyes and wished each other well. Even though it was 7 am it still hit me, I alone now. I went to bed a little longer and then met up with my friend Jacob. Jacob and I had breakfast and I asked him about his takeaways from his Thailand trip. We also said our goodbyes before I took my van towards Khao Sok National Park. In the van to Khao Sok I researched many topics. Should I write about economics or physics today? Let’s go with economics since I learned some interesting stuff. I chatted with a very smart man, well versed in the socioeconomics of Asia. I told him about how Bhutan is looking to revolutionize their economy and explore a digital revolution. He gave me pros and cons of Bhutan but ultimately said that “plans are good, but they are not the same as abilities” I have come across this idea many times on my journey. Investors want to see real data and ways to get their money back, not just pretty pictures and qualitative descriptions. The proof is in the numbers they say. Bhutan has a GDP per capita of 3000 USD, adjusted for purchasing parity it is 3-4 times bigger. Purchasing parity is an economic theory used to compare the relative value of currencies by exempting the cost of a standard basket of goods in different countries. It adjusts for price level differences, providing a more accurate measure of the economic productivity and living standards between nations. For example, if a basket of goods costs $100 in the US and 2,000 Ngultrum in Bhutan, the purchasing parity is 2000/100 ‎ = 20
                BTN/USD. The purchasing power rate indicates how much of one currency are equivalent to the other in terms of purchasing power. Now, if the nominal exchange rate is 80 BTN per USD, but the PPP rate is 20 BTN/USD, it suggests that goods are relatively cheaper in Bhutan. The discrepancy indicates that the Bhutanese currency is undervalued, as it takes more BTN to purchase a US dollar on the foreign exchange market. When GDP per capita is higher when adjusted for purchasing power parity compared to nominal it suggests price levels are lower domestically. Also, Bhutan’s GDP is heavily reliant on non-tradable sectors like tourism. Since there are not a lot of exports, Bhutan generates limited foreign currency, which keeps the nominal value of its currency low relative to major currencies. Finally Bhutan is now deeply integrated into global trade and financial systems which limits demand of the Ngultrum internally. Nominal value of the exchange rate reflects international perceptions of the economy, not the actual purchasing power in Bhutan. Overall the important takeaway is that purchasing power parity compared to (PPP) adjusts the raw economic numbers to reflect purchasing power, giving a clearer picture of economic well being. Also, I never thought about how doing more international business creates a demand for a country’s currency, thus raising the nominal value. An example of an overvalued currency where the nominal exchange rate is higher than the PPP is the Swiss Franc. Another big takeaway from the conversation I had was the growth of Vietnam. I have heard backpackers say Vietnam is their favorite country for the culture and nature, but now I am hearing the economy is on a great trajectory. Even though the government calls themselves communist, there are plans in motion for it to become an international financial hub. if that is the case money will flock there, like in UAE and Singapore. Anyway I am here in Khoa Sok a national park north of Phuket. I will be doing a jungle safari and staying on a floating bungalow in an emerald lake tomorrow. I look forward to being back in nature and hopefully it is not too touristy. I came to Khoa Sok without booking an excursion but found one through my hostel. Hopefully it is good! </p>

            <h3>January 6th 2025, Phuket, Thailand</h3>
            <p> A treatise on Thai culture. I have been in south Thailand for about three weeks now and have begun to make some conclusions on Thai people and culture. Firstly, Thailand is a tourist playground. It is cheap and the sites are beautiful. Thailand is also extremely safe. There is no petty or severe crime that I have witnessed or heard of.  That being said, Thailand is effectively a lawless country. There are weed shops on every corner and blatant prostitution that attempts to hide behind massage parlors. It is interesting that with such little police enforcement that the country is so safe. It could be due to the historical peaceful buddhist culture. However, currently, Thailand is not a religious country whatsoever. Muay Thai is a big part of the culture here too, with many fights occurring almost every day. I have used these past three weeks as a sort of “half time” to my trip. This is because I have been in very touristy destinations where families are on vacation rather than rugged backpacker spots off the grid. Also it is because these are the last few weeks Zach and I will be together. Tomorrow I will start the second half of the trip, going by myself and back into the lands less explored and touched by tourists. The first half was filled with such adventure, I will need to find new and exciting ways to travel alone throughout the second half. Honestly I do not care to “sight see” or see more beautiful beaches. I want to be immersed in culture, learn about people and history and the future, and continue to do adventurous challenging things. A part of being more present requires not planning too much in the future. I do not want to book hostels or a route until the day before or day of. This will allow me to be flexible while present. I do have a route in mind though I will share now. I will go to the north of Thailand and then enter Laos. From Laos I will work south and go through Cambodia. From Cambodia I will enter and explore Vietnam. After Vietnam it is possible I will go to the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Australia, and more. This afternoon Zach and I recapped the past 3.5 months together. We told each other our biggest takeaways, our favorite parts, and the most important learnings. We both agreed Nepal was our favorite country. We also agreed smaller more off the grid experiences, like Diani Beach are the best kind. we both agreed we are more grounded and appreciative for our upbringing then ever, but still stay committed to the spiritual path. It was crazy to reflect on this amazing trip together and our past trips too. </p>

            <h3>January 3rd 2025, Phuket, Thailand</h3>
            <p> We live in a disposable generation. The term coined by the esteemed Rabbi Yossi of Miami Ohio made me think about my generation and the various issues we face. While walking to Freedom Beach today I noticed a couple of holes in my shirt. My first instinct was to throw it out and get a new one. However I was stopped by thoughts of the disposable generation. Gen Z, for lack of a better word, is so quick to dispose of something in replace of a newer thing. People tend to think newer is directly correlated to better. This can range from material possessions all the way to relationships. Our generation was bombarded with so much data, so many options, from such a young age. People have therefore been programmed to always jump to the next, coolest thing. The idea of the disposable generation is clearly linked with instant gratification. Gen Z is much less willing to invest in long term wins, but instead want quick gratification, even at the means of disposing of something great. This is a huge problem. It may be the biggest problem we face because it manifests itself in various aspects of society. When something seems broken, people are too quick to throw it out instead of working and fixing it. This can be seen at work, friendships, relationships, etc. It is critical for the development of adult men and women to learn to work and build something they started. The grass is not always greener on the other side they say. Now, I recently talked with my dear friend Mendy Plotkin about the idea of presence. Gen Z also faces a presence crisis. At social events people are seen on their phones and instead of enjoying a concert people are always taking pictures and videos. I believe this is related to the disposable generation. If the most important moment of your life is the present, then you are working and building this moment with all your might. However if you are always waiting for the next experience or too busy reminiscing on the past, you throw away the present. Now I want to apply these ideas to my life philosophy. As stated throughout my posts, I want to build something great I can pass down to the future generation. To be able to be a man of a great empire you must invest vigorously in the present and build off of the foundations that were previously set for you. Even if one lego falls while you are building a mighty castle, it does not mean you should start over, but rather find a new way to continue to build onward and upward. Here is to radical presence. </p>

            <h3>January 1st 2025, Koh Pha Ngan, Thailand</h3>
            <p> Happy New Year! A couple days ago I met up with my friend Jacob from Dallas. He is here in Thailand traveling on vacation. Four months ago we talked about meeting up here and I am very happy and grateful that our plans worked out. Last night Zach Jacob and I went to the famous full moon party on Haad Rin Beach. First of all Haad Rin Beach is such a beautiful beach. It is about a 1.5 km beach that is super wide and surrounded by mountains on both sides. I started thinking about the criteria which makes a beach great. Depth of sand, quality of sand, color of water, surrounding fauna...As I mentioned earlier I have barely drank or gone out at all on this trip so I was skeptical at first if this world famous Full moon party would be fun. Typically the party only occurs on the full moon, but they put on a special edition for the new year. Long story short it lived up to the hype and was really fun. There were so many different genres of music you can listen to in different areas and walk around the whole beach. It was almost like a small little city. There were over 5000 people for sure. I jumped a rope burning with fire and got burnt a little. There were various activities and things to do. Now that being said, I do not like partying much. Typically the type of people partying attracts are not the ones you want to be surrounded with for growth. To grow into a true respected man you have to distinguish yourself as distinct from the herd with immoveable values. In 2025 I really intend to cut out drinking and going out for the health and growth reasons. In 2024 I believe I was really good at this as well and want to keep it up as I continue to level up. Today I just finished reading my book The Black Tulip, by Alexandre Dumas, and it was fantastic. Zach also read a book by this author titled, The Count of Monte Cristo. In both of these books the idea of aristocracy is brought up a lot. This relates to the thoughts I just detailed about distinguishing yourself as a man with immovable values distinct from the masses. In medieval Europe, the aristocracy was a cornerstone of the feudal system, a hierarchical structure where land was the primary source of wealth and power. The various classes rarely mixed or intermarried, creating distinct identities and authorities. Fast forward a couple hundred years and the feudal system does not exist anymore in the west, for better or for worse. Now, important and interesting ideas can be taken from the concept of aristocracy and the feudal system. If you desire to make a respected empire out of you and your family, you must hold yourself to certain values and sacrifice certain things that others cannot or are not willing to do. In the modern sense, for example, that means separating yourself from modern party culture. Now when you do that you create a “class distinction” between two sets of people. You should be careful not to look down upon anyone as the feudal system did, but to create everyone with compassion and respect for where they are at. When you create a set of values that hopefully promotes a life of growth and respect, you inevitably create a distinction between who, where and what you will associate with. You never saw a Royal Monarch gambling at the local bar with the towns people right? Now, interestingly enough, the class system does exist in some places, meaning it is not an antiquated phenomenon. The caste system in India shares similarities with feudalism in that it is a hierarchical structure that historically divided society into rigid, hereditary groups. However, it is fundamentally different in its origins, basis, and persistence in the modern era. I recommend everyone to research the caste system of India since I do not want to expand on it too much here. We leave this beautiful island life for the peninsula of Phuket tomorrow for 5 more days. This is the final stretch here in the south of Thailand and with my travels with Zach. I hope to enjoy the last days together and to begin 2025 off with a bang. Here is to creating a noble, respected empire for my family and future family.</p>
