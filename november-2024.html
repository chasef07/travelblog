            <h2>Wednesday November 20th 2024, Kigali, Rwanda</h2>
            
            <p> Today was a hardcore adventure capitalism day. I woke up pretty early and started walking the city to try and get a pulse of the area. I went to Question coffee and had an iced caramel latte, probably the best coffee I have had in my life. After I walked towards the city center to explore. Walking on the street I saw so many ambitions projects and advertisements. The city is so clean and super safe. There are a bunch of motorcycle taxis where everyone is required to wear a helmet. There are dedicated areas which are “car free zones”. At times it did really feel like I was walking in a utopia. The weather was great and the rolling hills throughout the city are beautiful. Rwanda is known as the land of a thousand hills. After a long walk of exploring I came back to my guesthouse and ordered a pineapple juice with lunch. I spent a solid two hours researching various things. It ranged from a podcast with Javier Milei to mindfulness city project starting in Bhutan. After my research session I went to the gym and hit the sauna. I was pretty tired from walking the hills and the sauna but I had a business meeting I scheduled tonight. I met with a guy named Matt who is a real deal adventure capitalist. Zach met Matt’s business partner in SF a year ago and we have been in contact ever since. Matt owns a restaurant/bar in Kigali and I went and chatted and had dinner. The food and margarita were fantastic, real authentic Mexican food. We talked about investment opportunities, his life story, and geopolitics. I learned a lot. He emphasized the importance of building something that excites you and having the right connections. He knows people very high up in the Rwanda government which helps speed projects along. He also is friendly with police chiefs which helps him run his bar too. Similar to the conversation I had with the Kenyan woman yesterday he said how bad the corruption is in Africa. He emphasized how Rwanda and Tanzania have stable governments. It was really cool hearing all the awesome projects he works on. I think it would be pretty easy to raise money for a cool project. The problem I struggle with is foreseeing how one investment property can scale to becoming a full fledge entrepreneur. He told me the only was is to really get investors and build a big project if you do not have the capital yourself. He likes the restaurant industry as well as the manufacturing industry and told me how there is a plethora of opportunities in Africa for the taking. The hard part is just choosing the one that gets you excited. Zach is still being held in Mombasa, awaiting chemical analysis of the bullet shell in his backpack. Hopefully we will meet in Dubai on Sunday and he is able to get out quickly and smoothly. </p>

            <h2>Tuesday November 19th 2024, Kigali, Rwanda</h2>
            
            <p> Today was a long and wild day. Zach and I woke up at 4:00 AM to catch an 8 AM train in Mombasa. The shuttle was an hour late to pick us up from our hostel in Diani so we decided to uber the 1.5 hour drive there. It was still pretty cheap. At the train station we passed through security but Zach's bag got stopped. The security guard opened his backpack and saw an empty bullet shell. The security guard called his boss and Zach had to explain the situation. He got the bullet shell from Israel as a souvenir and left it in his bag. We have travelled through 4 different countries and no security system has caught it. It is crazy that the train station of Kenya was the first to find it. After explaining his story the Boss of the trains station did not buy it one bit. He thought Zach was sent from the US or Israel to test the Kenyan security systems and write a report on it. He was super paranoid. He did not believe the bullet travelled through 4 different countries undetected, which is a reasonable thought. I do not know how it got through undetected either. Zach and I were taken to a holding room in the train station for interrogation. They took our passports and train tickets. Zach explained the story over and over and the station chief refused to believe it. He said that Zach was intentionally trying to confuse and trick him. At one point Zach and I laughed at the craziness of the situation and the train boss accused us of conspiring a plan to escape. He was really paranoid. After 1.5 hours the boss told me I could leave since the bullet was not in my possession. I asked Zach if it was okay I take the train to catch the flight to Rwanda and he said yes. I wished him good luck and hoped it would all breeze over quickly. The 6 hour train sucked. I was so tired and it was so hot and sweaty. I sat next to a 7 person Muslim family with kids kicking and screaming which did not enhance the experience. After the train I smoothly made it to the airport. I took one of the best showers of my life in the lounge, my first hot shower maybe all trip. The flight to Kigali was smooth and fast. Upon landing I was already blown away. The friendliness and beauty of the city sticks out. There was nobody at the airport haggling me for a taxi or trying to sell me shit. The weather was phenomenal, cool and crisp. The hills throughout the city are stunning. I did not see a single piece of trash on the street. It really could be the cleanest city I have ever seen. I am so tired right now so I am going to head to sleep. I am really excited to explore Kigali tomorrow and hope Zach gets out of the Kenyan holding cell as soon as possible. </p>

            <h2>Tuesday November 19th 2024, Nairobi, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> Thoughts from the 6 hour train from Mombasa to Nairobi:

                On my past travels you have excitement to go sight see, explore and take in everything as quick as possible. When travel is your lifestyle, the whole outlook and mindset shifts. It’s impossible to be on the move and sight see all the time. As I look back to my travels, Spain, Korea or Iceland etc, I realize the most profound experiences are just by integrating and being in the society, not running around sight seeing. This shift means I have to take the travels slower and be okay missing some “tourist sights”. Instead the goal of this is to learn about the people, the culture, and to solely bear witness. In Africa there are lots of expensive treks and tourist activities, but just bearing witness of the people and how they live makes it all worth it. I’m going to Rwanda now for the same reason. There’s not much to actually sight see or do, but it is extremely interesting to see the people and culture and how the country is moving. This can be thought of as a “second education”. I am on a journey to reeducate myself about the world, history, work, and outlook on life. It is not a journey to sight see and be a passerby. When ranking my travels in the past I ranked them by food, city/land scapes, and variety of activities. This is still a good benchmark but it was missing a key component, the people. Getting to know the people and their worldviews is invaluable.
                This week in Diani I talked with Germans, Spaniards, Brits, Swiss, Kenyans, Tanzanians, and Israelis of course. It was interesting hearing about how they viewed the world and their respective countries. Specifically interesting to me, the Germans Spaniards and Brits did not like the outlook of their countries and think they are growing in the wrong direction. I think this is the case of all of Western Europe which is facing social crisis like immigration and crime as well as low economic growth opportunity. 
                Every country I have travelled to so far has actually been more religious than I expected. When was the last time you heard of an actual Christian country? In Georgia the people and especially the young people take religion seriously. You’ll see a 19 year old girl in tattoos and a mini skirt doing the cross over herself at the sight of a church, a combination unheard of in the west. In Georgia I realized that there really are no Christian countries anymore in the west. It was interesting to see conservative values and the importance of religion in Georgia to the youth and how integrated it is in society. Now even more surprising is that the people in Africa are very religious as well. Many are devout Christians and Muslims. Many of the young Kenyans and Tanzanians have great awe for G-d and in their daily talk it is apparent it is important in their life. You see a lot of Africans wearing full hijabs too which indicates Islamic conservatism. In developed countries it seems religious and conservative values fade while in developing countries it is the fabric holding the society together. This made me think, why are developed nations more likely to leave conservative religious values for a more liberal framework. I have many thoughts on this but it deserves a whole essay in itself. 
                Near the end of my six hour train ride to Nairobi I talked with a Kenyan woman. She said the biggest problem with Kenya is corruption. Also, Kenya is teeming with natural resources, but due to government incompetence there are no factories to refine or manufacture them. This leads to Kenya needing to export the natural resources out to then import the finished products back in. Throughout this process developed countries take advantage of the poorer nation of Kenya and the incompetent government. Kenya also needs to take loans from wealthy nations and then becomes debt trapped, specifically from China. Lastly, the corruption goes so far that even if you go to university it’s hard to find a job. You need to pay someone in the know to get a good job. The woman thought that an African union would be beneficial but neighboring countries in East Africa hate each other. Corruption eats everything.</p>

            <h2>Monday November 18th 2024, Diani, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> Pole-pole is the Swahili phrase for “slowly, slowly”. It is used during long treks like climbing Mt Kilimanjaro to remind climbers to conserve energy. While learning how to kite surf my instructor also told me, pole-pole, to be patient and confident to control the kite. Even deeper it is an Eastern African philosophy for everyday life: to be calm, patient and steady. This past week on the coast of Kenya I have definitely been soaking in the pole-pole energy. The locals here, and East Africans in general, live a simple, non-sophisticated life and are generally happy and satisfied. In the US we overcomplicate so many things, thus leading to energy expended and wasted in the wrong areas of life. At first it was a challenge for me to be slow and simple because I am a busy body by nature, always trying to do or see the next thing. I have learned a lot from taking this week on the beach just to live, breathe, and be simple. However, I am ready to be on the go again. I thrive in scenarios where my energies are pushed to the limit and I must be decisive with how to spend my time. This week of relaxation has given me renewed vigor to take my focus, health, and intellect to the next level. Typically people say the male pre-frontal cortex becomes fully developed by the age of 25. Of course this is just an estimate but it gives me a good benchmark to really level up in the next five months. Zach and I head to Rwanda tomorrow for five days to explore the cleanest, safest city in Africa. We researched Kigali, Rwanda over a year ago, excited about the progressive outlook of the country! After Rwanda, on Sunday, we fly to Dubai for a day trip towards the country of Nepal. In Nepal we have a really exciting itinerary I look forward to updating here about. </p>

            <h2>Sunday November 17th 2024, Diani, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> It is Sunday morning on the beaches of Kenya overlooking the Indian Ocean and I am sitting here reflecting on my trip. I am two months into my adventure. I have been on the beach of Diani for a week, taking life slow and improving my body and mind. What comes to mind right now is the idea of community. I realized and cemented the importance of community. It has been cool in Diani being in a place where there is not a lot of people and you get to meet people more than once and create a form of community. I have been playing volleyball everyday with the same people and have met some of the workers at the resorts here. This weekend Zach and I hung out with all the locals and they taught us afro-beats dances. It was nice forming that bond, not as a one-off thing, but as a continual community building process. That being said I can’t help to dichotomize the community process here in Diani Beach Kenya and the community I have in Dallas. Having a central place to socialize is key for any community building. Here it is the hostel and in Dallas it is Chabad. Any good community has a solid center. When I think of the future of urban planning, having a center place which is not overcrowded is key to make a community blossom. The morning routine I have here is great. The morning you have the ability to open your psyche or make it more cluttered. The key steps I have found to make sure your mind is not stiff in the morning and throughout the day are : nature, water, move the body, read/write/think/pray, no screens. These things simultaneously abstract yourself out of your mind and take you within to help you kickstart your day. Now thinking ahead, the next couple of months are really exciting. I am really looking forward to the nature and beauty of Nepal. A big part of traveling is connecting with the people, culture, and food of each place. I believe Nepal will be super unique in all aspects. It is seeming that I will have time to go through Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam fully and at times alone. It will be important to integrate my learnings over the past two months into the Southeast Asia part of the trip. That means creating mini-communities by staying in one location while also moving when the time is right and choosing excursions wisely. There will be lots more beach time and beach volleyball ahead I presume. Finally, my money dedicated for this trip will run out in the near future. There are many exciting ways I can see that process unfolding and how I integrate all of my learnings from this trip. For now staying present is the most important thing but I cannot help but think about the possibilities ahead. </p>

            <h2>Thursday November 14th 2024, Diani, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> I have not worn shoes in days. It has been so nice waking up and walking straight to the beach to workout. The weather is beautiful here and the hostel is amazing. Today was Ron’s last day with us. I am very grateful for him and his friendship, coming to spend 10 days here with us in Africa. We grew our connection and had very meaningful conversations. We push each other to be the best versions of ourselves, which is hard to come by in friendships these days. After Ron left Zach and I talked about our long term vision for the trip and beyond. I have been having trouble seeing how  investments scale to generational wealth. I thought maybe you can get lucky on a few investments in real estate or stocks, make it big, and be chilling for your life. Exploring various businesses and talking to serial entrepreneurs proved to me that building real wealth takes time, effort and money. It is such a blessing I am only 24 years old and have time to find something I am passionate about to work and build on. Even 34 years of age is pretty young relative to an average lifespan these days. When I think about 10 years of hard work and smart investments that is the only way to build real wealth. Being patient is a real skill I think I have been gifted with and need to utilize. After our conversation Zach and I hit a hard workout on the beach. I really have been enjoying having the time to move my body and build it healthily. When you are stuck in a 8 hour work day it is hard to find that time to really work on yourself without rushing to the next commitment. Having the time and space to reflect and work on myself has been priceless. I am coming up on two months of traveling. What I realized is that is a long time! Every day you can curate and grow so much! Each day has infinite potential. In corporate America you “live for the weekend” because the week is filled with rushing and the same cycles. When you step out of this construct you realize how much time a day really is and how much nuance and uniqueness a 24 hour cycle can bring. I value and thrive off structure but I think it is essential to mix it up often as well. </p>

            <h2>Monday November 11th 2024, Diani, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> Today was one of the best days of the trip. I woke up to the sun after my first good nights sleep in a while. I started my day with yoga on the beach and then went on a run. Along the way I stopped because I was feeling gassed, I haven’t ran in a while. I talked to people on the beach selling random stuff and had some interesting conversations. I probably walked and ran the beach for 2.5 hours. It was so amazing to start my day slowly and with exercise and with sunlight. I could literally see my psyche unraveling in real time. After the run I came back to our awesome hostel, Galu’s  Backpackers and had a mango smoothie. Ron and I had an amazing discussion about life and relationships over breakfast. After breakfast I read some of my new book, Doughnut Economics. Around 2PM Ron and I got lunch at a nearby place. It took two hours for our food to come. After lunch we talked with the kite surfing guy to give us an intro lesson. We ended up getting a two hour lesson for 50 bucks each, a pretty good deal. Learning how to fly the kite was fun. I want to become a master of earth wind fire and water and sports that bring that out are the best! After kite surfing Zach Ron and I played volleyball at the resort next door. I love volleyball and am pretty good at it so it was fun to get some competition going. The people we played against were pretty good. After that we went to dinner and karaoke. It was a great day. I value being able to take time to myself to think and to use my body to stay healthy and play sports and learn new skills. </p>

            <h2>Sunday November 10th 2024, Diani, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> Africa is very hard to backpack. Firstly you cannot really hang out in the major cities. When you travel Europe you can spend a whole day just wandering side streets. However in Africa the cities are dirty and spread out with not much to see or do. Also the food can be sketchy sometimes and there is not an emphasis on the dining experience. Africa is also hard to backpack due to the lack of public transport. There’s no clear way to know how to get between cities. Today we took a private shuttle from Moshi to the coast of Kenya. It was very expensive but the only way to get there. If you do find a way to use a bus it’ll take a very long time and will be crowded. A bus from Nairobi to Kampala is 13 hours. This is normal in Africa and people take very long bus rides. It’s possible but it is exhausting and not the most comfortable. The people on the street beg for money and try to sell you things nonstop which does not help the experience. I really wanted to like Africa a lot. I appreciate the unique culture but it is not my favorite place to travel. The tourist activities are extremely expensive due to high national park entrance fees. There is amazing nature but it costs a lot. I think everyone should come to Africa to understand how the people live. They live simply and happily. The poverty is striking and makes you appreciate what you have. Being back in Kenya on the coast made me understand the differences between Kenya and Tanzania for the first time. Tanzania is less developed but the people are nicer. Kenya has a better night life scene but is more sketchy than Tanzania. Both countries are very cheap food and accomodation wise. I am looking forward to getting back to relaxing, working out and getting a tan! </p>

            <h2>Saturday November 9th 2024, Moshi, Tanzania</h2>
            
            <p> I  just returned from a six day, five night safari. I abstained from using my phone to be immersed in nature and to take the experience in fully. Zach, Ron and I went to four national parks: Terengere, Ngorogoro, Serengeti, and Lake Manyara. We also woke up at 5 am for a hunt with the Hadzabe tribe, one of the last hunter gatherer tribes left on earth. It was a life changing experience that I would recommend to anyone. Here are some key takeaways: live in touch with nature and its cycles, be grateful for the bare necessities not everyone has them, eat healthy, be patient and compassionate, master boredom, put yourself out there for others, don't be ashamed, dive into the unknown, stand up for what you believe in, learn interesting and new things. These takeaways came from seeing so many amazing animals throughout the day and driving through rural Africa seeing how millions of people live under unfortunate conditions. What struck me was that when we saw animals in the parks, most of the time they were sleeping or just standing still. I thought I would see some wild hunt or action, but the majority of times these beautiful creatures were just being. As humans we complicate so many things, because we are complicated creatures. However, it is important to remember to stay simple. Not having my phone and being in nature realized how much time a single day really is. There is infinite potential in a 24 hour period to grow, live, and change. When I was working the same routine made it seem like you are going around in circles, not upward. Being able to step outside of this has made me appreciate and understand how much can truly be accomplished in a single day. Next, we drove by many mud huts and houses made of solely sticks and bushes. It was sad to see so many people living in extreme poverty. Even though these people did not have much, they were so happy and kind and appreciative for their own life. I have seen movies and read books about Africa, but seeing the people and their life in person really makes a difference. I would urge people to come to Africa solely for this purpose. Lastly, hunting with the Hadzabe tribe was an insane experience. We woke up super early and went to see the tribe. The tribe speaks with clicks for some of their words. They do not know the time or when they were born. They start hunting when the birds start chirping and know their age based on the seasons. They hunt baboon, birds, squirrels, kudu and more. We hunted with three boys/men who caught a couple birds and a squirrel. Sometimes they do not eat for days if they do not catch anything. Zach brought up a good point of how we should go hunting more back home to be in touch with catching food from the source and going back to our ancestral roots. There is so much more to day about these past 6 days but this is what comes to mind. Here are just a few pictures from the safari. </p>

            <h2>Sunday November 3rd 2024, Arusha, Tanzania</h2>
            
            <p> I woke up at 6:45 AM to catch the bus to Arusha. While waiting for the bus I saw some guys steal a motorcycle and drive off with it. People ran and chased after him but it was too late. The shuttle to Arusha took about 5 hours total. The drive was not too bad. On the drive down I saw lots of traditional tribal people dressed in elaborate garb. I also saw little kids herding animals with sticks. Driving outside of the city center in Africa for the first time really opened my eyes to how differently people live. There was extreme poverty lining the roads with mud shacks. People walked barefoot in the scorching sun on the highway. People live simply and do not complain. It is so crazy how much we take for granted in the US and how such trivial our problems really are. At the Tanzania border my Yellow fever exemption worked easily. I had to pay 100 dollars for a visa to enter. I arrived in Arusha and Ron arrived from Israel at about the same time! We walked around the city and chatted. We stumbled upon a second division soccer game and watched twenty minutes of it. After, the owner of the safari company which we are taking tomorrow came to our hotel and met up with us to give us the run down. His name is Solomon and he was very nice and down to earth. We decided to do a five night, six day safari filled with many different stops and experiences. I cannot wait to be immersed in nature and hopefully see a bunch of amazing animals! </p>

            <p> I haven’t given my first impressions on Africa, let me do that. They drive on the left side of the road which is interesting. Everything is pretty cheap except the touristy experiences. Nairobi is not the cleanest city. It is hot and dirty. The people seem nice but there is definitely some looks you get as a muzungu, white person. Everyone speaks really good English here, way better than Israel and Georgia. The people also speak Swahili which is cool. You do see poverty and people begging in the streets. A lot of people are selling random shit like white boards, flashlights, hats, just to make some money. I really like it so far all things considered though! Nairobi is one of the most developed cities, but it is still less developed than I expected. Today I tried ostrich meatballs which was pretty yummy and interesting at The Carnivore Restaurant. I had a traditional East African dish called Ugali, see the food page for details. Tomorrow I wake up early and head to Tanzania for a 5 day Serengeti safari. Hopefully crossing the border goes smoothly. Ron will meet up with us in Tanzania tomorrow for a week and a half! That’ll be fun. Still processing all that information from yesterday wow! </p>

            <h2>Friday November 1st 2024, Nairobi, Kenya</h2>
            
            <p> I slept terribly. I woke up twice to the sound of the call to prayer. There is a mosque next door to the hostel. There was some road noise as well. I went to meet up with my mom’s friend from high school Erik, who currently lives in Nairobi early in the morning at the Village Market. Erik started and runs a nonprofit called “Enabling Peace in Iraq Center (EPIC)”. We had an amazing two hour conversation all about geopolitics, government, and traveling. The amount of information he blasted me with was insane, I was actually overwhelmed. Here are some key highlights. Kenya has a huge population, about 56 million, made up of more than 40 distinct tribes. Nairobi is a bubble in Kenya due to the UN presence here bringing rich expats in. There are two economies in Nairobi, one that serves the expats with nice shopping and restaurants and the economy for the rest of Kenyans. People are coming to Nairobi for tech and opportunity. Labor is exploited heavily in Kenya. I took a 45 minute uber for 10 dollars. A 15 minute trip is like 3 bucks. He said Ethiopia is beautiful and has lots of potential after the civil war. Uganda is stable but has the worst government. Rwanda has fake stability from the dictator in power there even though he does a lot of good. Iraq’s biggest problem is Iran presence in the region. He said I could come to Kurdistan with him sometime. We talked about business in the fields of agriculture, energy, tourism. He told me that Kenya has enough food here at home but they import most of their goods due to government incompetence. Everybody here is on “Africa time”, people show up late and are not in a rush, it taught him how to slow down. He gave me a book about how to think about economics in a sustainable way. Overall he was super cool and super smart, I learned so much from him. After meeting up with him Zach and I roamed the city and went to a fruit market. Zach has not been feeling well the past couple days so I went to the Nairobi Hebrew Congregation for Shabbat services myself. I met the Rabbi Netaniel there who is super cool and a young guy. I told him my trip outline and he tore it apart and redesigned the trip for me. He has travelled all over the world and met over 1000 backpackers so he is very knowledgeable in how to get the most out of the experience. He advised to explore countries fully and slowly before moving to the next place. Do not just hop around to check a country off your list. He told me a month in Uganda is a must, which I previously overlooked. Since we are only in Nairobi for three days he said we should come back and do Kenya properly this trip. The synagogue was beautiful and on a huge plot of land with great nature. I met some expats living there in Nairobi too. Overall this day was filled with an overwhelming amount of intimation I am still processing. Today was the ay I realized I had to switch to a backpackers mindset. The past 6 weeks had been nice exploring business and chilling in Israel/ Georgia but now the true backpacking adventure starts. Especially in Africa it takes a lot more planning to make sure you stay safe and hit the good spots efficiently. Also he advised to minimize border hopping between countries because it’s a long process. Explore a country fully then move on. </p>
