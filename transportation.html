                        Kathmandu is a small city with tight streets. There are often traffic jams due to motorbikes and cars wizzing around. There are not really any street lights or street signs. The only way to get around is via taxi, which you have to hail. There is a ride share app but I have not tried it. Nepal transport score: 4.9/10

                    In Kigali there are thousands of motorcycle taxis. You can get one wherever on the side of the street. A ride for ten minutes costs 75 cents. There is a bus system but it is not extensive. The city is layered with hills so getting around on the motorcycles is quick, easy, and efficient. Rwanda transport score: 6.7/10

                The best way to get around in Tanzania is by taxi or public shuttle. Similar to Kenyan matatus, Tanzania has dala-dalas, which are small, crowded, and unpredictable in schedule. Tanzania transport score: 4.1/10

                Uber is the main mode of transport in Kenya. A 45-minute Uber ride can cost less than 10 USD. You can also order a motorcycle for a cheaper, quicker option. Trains connect Nairobi to Mombasa, and buses travel to Tanzania and Uganda. Matatus, privately-owned minibuses, operate on set routes but don’t follow strict schedules. Many are decorated with vibrant designs and even Israeli flags. Kenya transport score: 6.2/10

                In Tbilisi, a scenic cable car ride runs from Rike Park to the Narikala Fortress. The bus system in Tbilisi is efficient, with dedicated lanes and easy mobile payments. Buses cost 1 GEL (about 37 cents) and even have USB-C charging capabilities. Trains connect Tbilisi to Batumi, and car rentals are available for exploring smaller cities.

                Israel has robust public transport. Trains connect the airport to major cities, and the Jerusalem Light Rail provides local service. A Rav Kav card is required for public transit. For ride-hailing, Gett is an alternative to Uber, and the Moovit app helps with navigation. Buses are extensive but Google Maps sometimes lacks accurate timing. Israel transport score: 7.8/10
