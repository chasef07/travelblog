        <h1>My Moppie,</h1>
        <p>
            Words cannot describe the amount of love I feel for you. You are amazing in every single way. I love your beautiful smile. I love waking up next to you to start our day and cuddling you to sleep at night. I never knew I could love someone as much as I love you. You challenge me to be the best version of my self and I want to be the best I can for you. I want to make you feel so special, so loved. You are my everything, my world.  It feels like we were made for each other. We understand each other on such a deep level. You are so kind and caring and sweet. I am so grateful for you taking care of me and making me feel loved. I want to make you feel so loved everyday. You are so sporty and funny. I love playing kickies with you and surfing with you. I love laughing together until our bellies hurt. I love covering you in kisses on the back of the motorbike. I love holding you tight and when you hold me tight too. I love how much in common we have. Sharing cocos, or matcha or meals together makes me so grateful. I love sharing everything with you. I want to share my life with you. Everything feels so right with you. I love your adventurous side and how nothing will stop you when you put your mind to it. You inspire me and I learn so much from you. I love laughing with you, crying with you and being with you. I love how easy life is with you. I love all parts of you.
            <br><br>
            Ik hou van jou,<br>
