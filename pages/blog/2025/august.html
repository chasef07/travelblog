            <h3>Saturday, August 2nd, Clearwater, FL, USA</h3>
            
            <p>It’s been a week since I returned to Florida after 10 months of traveling the world, and it’s been a mix of emotions. The first few days were incredible—rediscovering all the amazing things Florida has to offer. I saw deer right outside my home, dolphins, manatees, seagulls, and pelicans. The sheer biodiversity here is something I truly appreciate.

                I remember in Indonesia, a girl from the UK told me she had never even seen a deer before. That really put it into perspective—being surrounded by wildlife on a daily basis is such a unique experience.
                
                In my last few weeks in Japan, I often wondered what it would feel like to come back. I thought I might feel out of place or disconnected. But as soon as I returned, I realized the transition was surprisingly smooth. If I didn’t feel out of place in the deep Himalayas, the countryside of Vietnam, or on the vast Indonesian seas, why would I feel out of place in my hometown where I spent 22 years of my life?
                
                Once I settled in, though, the cracks started to show—especially in the food. I paid $15 for a fruit bowl made from frozen fruit, not even grown locally. It’s such a stark contrast to life in Asia, where fruit is fresh, local, and dirt cheap. The food supply chain here feels broken, and the quality just isn’t there.
                
                Then I began noticing how many people seem… bored. Doing things they clearly don’t enjoy. At first, I didn’t notice many of the stereotypical “fat Americans” that Europeans always talk about, but as I got out more, I started to see them—overweight, sunburned, with random tattoos. I’m generally more compassionate these days, so it doesn’t bother me in a judgmental way, but it does make me think: if I’m choosing where to settle long-term, the U.S. is becoming less and less appealing. I want to be surrounded by people and an environment that energizes, pushes, and challenges me.
                
                For now, I’m making the most of it—working on exciting projects, spending time at the beach, going out on the boat. It’s a great lifestyle, and I can’t complain. But I know I can’t get too comfortable. My plan is to take all the lessons I’ve learned from the past year and put them into practice: keep working out, eat healthy, keep growing
